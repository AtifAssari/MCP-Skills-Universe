Apple App Store ASO Optimization
Overview

This skill enables comprehensive Apple App Store Optimization (ASO) analysis and metadata generation. Analyze existing app listings, generate optimized metadata following Apple's guidelines and character limits, provide competitive insights, and recommend screenshot storyboard strategies.

Core Workflow

When a user requests ASO optimization or metadata review:

Analyze the App Context

Understand the app's purpose, features, and target audience
Identify unique value propositions and competitive differentiators
Note any changes or updates the user mentions

Load ASO Knowledge Base

Reference references/aso_learnings.md for comprehensive ASO best practices
Apply competitive analysis strategies
Use proven optimization patterns

Generate Optimized Metadata

Create optimized app name, subtitle, and promotional text
Write compelling description with keyword optimization
Generate keyword list with strategic placement
Ensure all metadata follows Apple's character limits

Validate Character Counts

Use scripts/validate_metadata.py to verify all metadata meets Apple's requirements
Display validation results with character counts and limit compliance
Flag any violations with specific corrections needed

Provide Screenshot Strategy

Recommend screenshot storyboard sequence
Suggest messaging hierarchy and visual focus areas
Align screenshot strategy with metadata messaging
Apple App Store Character Limits

Critical Limits to Validate:

App Name: 30 characters maximum
Subtitle: 30 characters maximum
Promotional Text: 170 characters maximum
Description: 4,000 characters maximum
Keywords: 100 characters maximum (comma-separated, no spaces)
What's New: 4,000 characters maximum
Metadata Validation Process

After generating recommendations, always validate using the validation script:

python scripts/validate_metadata.py


The script will:

Prompt for each metadata field
Calculate character counts
Check against Apple's limits
Display results with ✅ (pass) or ❌ (fail) indicators
Show exact character counts and remaining characters

Integration Pattern:

Generate metadata recommendations
Run validation script with recommended content
Display validation results to user
Adjust any failing fields and re-validate
Output Format

Structure recommendations as:

📱 App Metadata Recommendations

App Name (X/30 characters) [optimized name]

Subtitle (X/30 characters) [optimized subtitle]

Promotional Text (X/170 characters) [promotional text]

Keywords (X/100 characters) [keyword,list,no,spaces]

Description (X/4000 characters) [full description]

🎯 Competitive Analysis

[Key insights and positioning recommendations]

📸 Screenshot Storyboard Strategy

[Ordered list of screenshot recommendations with messaging]

✅ Validation Results

Krankie: App Store Ranking Tracker

Krankie is an agent-first CLI tool for tracking App Store keyword rankings. Use it to monitor keyword performance, track ranking changes over time, and inform ASO optimization decisions with real data.

Installation
bun install -g krankie
# or run directly
bunx krankie

Key Commands

App Management:

# Search for apps
krankie app search "<query>" --platform ios

# Add an app to track
krankie app create <app_id> --platform ios

# List tracked apps
krankie app list


Keyword Tracking:

# Add keywords to track for an app
krankie keyword add <app_id> "<keyword>" --store us

# List tracked keywords
krankie keyword list


Ranking Checks:

# Run ranking checks for all tracked keywords
krankie check run

# View current rankings
krankie rankings

# See biggest movers (gains/losses)
krankie rankings movers

# View ranking history for a keyword
krankie rankings history <keyword_id>

# Check status of last run
krankie check status


Automation:

# Install daily cron job (default: 6 AM)
krankie cron install --hour 6

# Check cron status
krankie cron status

Agent Integration

All commands support --json flag for structured output:

krankie rankings --json
krankie app list --json


Get agent-friendly instructions:

krankie instructions --format json

Data Notes
Rankings track positions 1-200; null indicates outside this range
Data stored locally in ~/.krankie/krankie.db (SQLite)
Daily re-checks are rate-limited; use --force to override
Logs available at ~/.krankie/check.log
ASO Workflow Integration
Before optimization: Use krankie rankings to establish baseline keyword positions
Competitive analysis: Track competitor apps and their keyword rankings
After metadata changes: Monitor krankie rankings movers to measure impact
Trend analysis: Use krankie rankings history to identify patterns
Resources
scripts/validate_metadata.py

Python script that validates App Store metadata against Apple's character limits. Provides interactive validation with clear pass/fail indicators.
