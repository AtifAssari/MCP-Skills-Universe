Package Scribe
Experimental caveat

This skill is experimental and not yet stable. Behavior, structure, and outputs may change between versions.

When to use

Use this skill when you need to systematically add or improve documentation across TypeScript packages — whether a full monorepo sweep or a single package.

Typical triggers:

"document all packages"
"improve docs for packages/utils/observable"
"add TSDoc to all public exports in this package"
"rewrite the README for this package"
"run a documentation pass on the monorepo"
"review the TSDoc quality in this package"

Implicit triggers:

A package has public exports with missing or stub TSDoc
A package README is outdated, inconsistent, or missing standard sections
A documentation sweep is planned across multiple packages
When not to use

Do not use this skill for:

Modifying runtime code (only doc comments and README files)
Generating API reference sites or TypeDoc output
Non-TypeScript languages (initial scope is TS/TSX only)
Auto-merging PRs or bypassing review workflows
Security vulnerability scanning or performance profiling
Replacing existing CI-based doc generation pipelines
Required inputs

If required inputs are missing or ambiguous, ask before proceeding.

Scope: monorepo root path or specific package path(s)
Mode: single (one package) or sweep (multiple packages)
Conditional inputs
Package filter: glob or list when processing a subset of packages
README template path: repo-specific template if not using the built-in default (for example under .github/instructions/)
Tracking issue: issue number for lifecycle updates (assign, status, close)
Commit style: repo-specific conventional commit format (defaults to docs(<package>): )
Batch size: number of packages per batch for sweep mode (defaults to 5)
Defaults
Mode: single (if only one package path provided)
Commit prefix: docs(<package-name>):
Batch size: 5 packages per sweep batch
README structure: built-in template from references/readme-template.md
Review council: enabled (runs after every package)
Precedence and standards discovery

This skill discovers and follows the target repository's own standards:

Repository instructions — applicable files under .github/instructions/, CONTRIBUTING.md, contribute/
Tooling configuration — tsconfig.json, biome.json, .editorconfig
Companion skill — fusion-code-conventions for TSDoc rules, naming conventions, and intent quality (when installed)
Built-in defaults — references/tsdoc-checklist.md and references/readme-template.md

Repository-level standards always win. When no repo standards exist, the built-in defaults apply.

Agent modes
Agent	Role	Activated for
agents/orchestrator.agent.md	Batch coordinator	Sweep mode — plans batches, manages token budgets, tracks progress
agents/documenter.agent.md	Per-package writer	Every package — scans API surface, generates TSDoc, rewrites README
agents/reviewer.agent.md	Review council	After each package — verifies intent, comprehension, retrieval fitness

In single-agent runtimes, all three roles run inline sequentially.

Instructions
Step 1 — Discover repository standards

Before generating any documentation:

Search for repo-level documentation instructions:
applicable files under .github/instructions/
CONTRIBUTING.md, contribute/
Read tsconfig.json to understand module structure, path aliases, and strict mode settings
Read biome.json or equivalent linter config for style expectations
Check if fusion-code-conventions is available — if so, defer to its TSDoc rules from references/typescript.conventions.md
If no repo-level standards exist, use references/tsdoc-checklist.md as the quality baseline
Step 2 — Discover packages
For single mode: validate the provided package path exists and has TypeScript source files
For sweep mode:
Read the root package.json or workspace config (pnpm-workspace.yaml, lerna.json, turbo.json) to find all packages
Filter by any provided glob/list
Sort packages by estimated size (file count) for batch planning
Write the discovery summary to .tmp/scribe-discovery-<context>.md
Step 3 — Plan execution (sweep mode only)

Activate agents/orchestrator.agent.md (or run inline):

Group packages into batches of the configured batch size
Order batches: smaller packages (fewer source files) first to maximize early throughput
Estimate token budget per package: ~100 tokens per source file for reading, ~200 tokens per export for TSDoc generation
If a single package exceeds 60% of the estimated context window, flag it for special handling (barrel exports first, defer internal modules)
Write the execution plan to .tmp/scribe-plan-<context>.md
Step 4 — Process each package

Activate agents/documenter.agent.md (or run inline) for each package:

4a — Scan public API surface
Find the barrel export file (index.ts, index.tsx, or main field in package.json)
Trace all re-exports to identify the full public API surface
Categorize exports: functions, classes, types/interfaces, constants, hooks, enums
Prioritize: barrel exports first, then direct public exports, then internally-consumed-but-exported items
4b — Generate or improve TSDoc

For each public export:

Read the existing implementation to understand intent, parameters, return values, error paths, and side effects
Check for existing TSDoc — improve rather than replace when present
Apply the TSDoc checklist (repo standards or references/tsdoc-checklist.md):
Summary line: explain why and what problem it solves, not just what it does
@param for every parameter with meaningful descriptions
@returns for every non-void function
@template for every generic type parameter
@throws for meaningful error paths
@example for user-facing and non-trivial public APIs
@deprecated with replacement guidance when applicable
Flag and rewrite "name-echo" patterns (for example /** Gets the value. */ getValue())
Do not modify runtime code — only doc comments
4c — Rewrite or improve README
Read the existing README (if any) to preserve valuable content
Apply the README structure from repo instructions or references/readme-template.md:
Package name and description
Features / key exports
Installation
Usage with code examples
API reference (summary of key exports with links or inline docs)
Configuration (if applicable)
Ensure the README is useful to a developer discovering the package for the first time
Optimize for retrieval: use clear headings, keyword-rich descriptions, and concrete examples
Step 5 — Review council

Activate agents/reviewer.agent.md (or run inline) after each package:

Intent extraction — Does the TSDoc accurately describe what the code does and why? Flag any comment that merely restates the function/type name.
Code comprehension — Are complex algorithms, state machines, or side effects explained? Would a new developer understand the code from the docs alone?
User-facing quality — Is the README useful to someone discovering the package for the first time? Does it have working examples?
Retrieval fitness — Will the documentation produce good hits in RAG / semantic search? Are key terms present in headings and summaries?

The reviewer produces a pass/fail per criterion. Failures loop back to Step 4 for the specific package.

Step 6 — Commit

After the review council passes for a package:

Stage only documentation files (.ts/.tsx files for TSDoc changes, README.md)
Commit using the repo's conventional commit format, defaulting to:
docs(<package-name>): improve TSDoc and README documentation

Do not push — leave that to the user or a PR workflow
Step 7 — Report

After all packages are processed:

Write a summary to .tmp/scribe-report-<context>.md:
Packages processed and status (pass/fail/skipped)
Total exports documented
Review council pass rates per criterion
Any packages flagged for manual review
Commits created
If a tracking issue was provided, update it with the summary
Expected output
TSDoc comments on all public exports in processed packages
Consistent README for each processed package
One commit per package with documentation-only changes
Summary report in .tmp/
Tracking issue update (when issue number provided)
Safety & constraints

This skill is mutation-capable. Repository-local workflow instructions take precedence over inline guidance when they conflict.

Only modify doc comments and README files — never touch runtime code
Do not push commits; leave push decisions to the user
Do not auto-merge PRs or bypass review workflows
Do not invent API behavior — document only what the code actually does
Do not delete or replace existing valuable documentation without preserving its content
When a tracking issue is referenced, update it only after explicit confirmation
Respect .gitignore and do not commit temporary files from .tmp/
If the review council fails a package twice, flag it for manual review instead of looping indefinitely
