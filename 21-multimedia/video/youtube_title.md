YouTube Title

This skill enables generation of high-performing YouTube video titles optimized for click-through rate (CTR). Titles are designed to spark curiosity, complement thumbnails, and compel viewers to click.

When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

The user asks to create a title for a YouTube video
The user requests title ideas or brainstorming for video content
The user wants to improve or optimize an existing video title
Working on YouTube content creation and a title is needed
The user asks for multiple title variations to test
Researching and ideating a new YouTube video idea
🚨 MANDATORY READING 🚨

CRITICAL: Before generating ANY title, you MUST read and internalize the design requirements: references/design-requirements.md

These requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every title must pass the design requirements checklist. Failure to follow these requirements will result in low-performing titles that do not drive clicks.

Core Principles (Summary)

The design requirements document contains the complete specifications, but the core principles are:

Curiosity is Mandatory: Every title MUST prompt a specific question in the viewer's mind
Complement, Don't Duplicate: Title must work WITH the thumbnail, not repeat it
No Generic Descriptions: Titles that merely describe content are rejected
Question Over Answer: Raise questions, don't answer them in the title
Prerequisites
Gather Context

Before generating titles, it's critical that you have all of the context and information about the proposed video/episode, the user's youtube channel, target audience, etc. If you don't already have it from the conversation, you must first gather this information from the user's local context and filesystem, youtube data, and finally asking the user directly if needed.

Gather the following information:

Required Information
Video topic/content: What is the video about?
Target audience: Who is this video for?
Key message: What's the main takeaway or hook?
Highly Recommended Information
Thumbnail description or image: What does the thumbnail show? What text is on it?
Target emotion: What emotion should the title evoke? (curiosity, shock, excitement, etc.)
Content type: Educational, entertainment, vlog, tutorial, etc.
Title Generation Workflow
Step 1: Gather Context

Ask the user for required information if not already provided:

To create an optimized title, I need to understand:
1. What is the video about? (topic/content)
2. Who is your target audience?
3. What's the main hook or takeaway?
4. Do you have a thumbnail? If so, what does it show and what text is on it?
5. What emotion should the title evoke?

Step 2: Read Design Requirements

MANDATORY ACTION: Read the complete design requirements: references/design-requirements.md

This document contains:

Curiosity generation requirements (MANDATORY)
Thumbnail complementarity requirements (MANDATORY)
Forbidden patterns to avoid
Content type applications
Title generation checklist
High-performing vs low-performing patterns
Quality standards and priority order
Step 3: Identify the Question

Before writing any title, identify the specific question you want in the viewer's mind:

What question will make them curious enough to click?
Does this question align with the video content?
Is the curiosity gap strong enough to drive action?

Examples of good questions to prompt:

"What mistakes am I making?" → "Big Mistakes Small YouTube Creators Still Make!"
"What happened?" → "I Should Have Seen This Coming..."
"Why would someone do that?" → "the GRILLED CHEESE I ate every other day for 2 years"
"Did they accept?" → "Offering People $100,000 To Quit Their Job"
Step 4: Generate Title Options

Generate 3-5 title variations that:

Prompt the identified question
Complement (not duplicate) the thumbnail
Align with the target emotion
Follow content type best practices (educational vs entertainment)

For each title, verify against the checklist:

 Curiosity Test: Does this prompt a specific question?
 Complementarity Test: Does this work WITH the thumbnail (not duplicate it)?
 Click Compulsion Test: Is the curiosity gap strong enough?
 Non-Descriptive Test: Does this go beyond merely describing?
 Target Audience Test: Will this resonate with the demographic?
Step 5: Present and Refine

Present the title options to the user with:

The title itself
The question it prompts in the viewer's mind
How it complements the thumbnail (if applicable)
Why it should drive clicks

Example presentation:

Here are 3 optimized title options:

1. "The AI Agent Mistake That Cost Me 10 Hours"
   - Prompts: "What mistake? How can I avoid it?"
   - Complements thumbnail showing frustrated face + error message
   - Creates urgency through time cost

2. "I Built This AI Agent Wrong (Here's What I Learned)"
   - Prompts: "What did they do wrong? What's the lesson?"
   - Personal experience framing creates relatability
   - Implies valuable learning without giving it away

3. "Why Your AI Agents Keep Breaking (And Mine Don't)"
   - Prompts: "Why do mine break? What's their secret?"
   - Creates contrast and curiosity
   - Positions viewer problem + solution tease

Step 6: Iterate Based on Feedback

If the user requests changes:

Understand what aspect needs adjustment (curiosity, tone, length, etc.)
Regenerate while maintaining design requirements compliance
Re-verify against the checklist
Common Patterns by Content Type
Educational Content (How-to, Tutorials)

Goal: Frame instruction to spark curiosity, not just inform

✅ "The Secret Technique Pro Chefs Don't Want You to Know"
✅ "I Tried the 'Impossible' Coding Challenge"
✅ "Why Everyone Does [X] Wrong (And How to Fix It)"
❌ "How to Chop Onions Properly"
❌ "Python Tutorial for Beginners"
Entertainment Content (Vlogs, Gaming)

Goal: Create intrigue through outcome uncertainty

✅ "Offering People $100,000 To Quit Their Job"
✅ "I Ate the Same Meal for 30 Days Straight"
✅ "They Didn't Believe Me Until..."
❌ "My Daily Vlog"
❌ "Playing Minecraft"
Tech/AI Content (User's Channel)

Goal: Combine education with curiosity and problem-solving

✅ "The AI Agent Pattern Nobody Talks About"
✅ "I Broke Production With This One Line of Code"
✅ "Why Your AI Agents Fail (And How to Fix Them)"
❌ "Building AI Agents Tutorial"
❌ "How to Use Claude API"
Quality Assurance
Priority Order (from Design Requirements)
Spark curiosity (highest priority)
Complement thumbnail
Raise viewer question
Create click compulsion
Rejection Criteria

REJECT and regenerate if the title:

Merely describes the content without sparking curiosity
Duplicates text that appears on the thumbnail
Answers the question instead of raising it
Uses generic patterns like "[Topic] Tutorial" without intrigue
Fails the "What question does this raise?" test
Success Criteria

A successful title:

Prompts a specific, compelling question in the viewer's mind
Works synergistically with the thumbnail
Creates a curiosity gap strong enough to drive clicks
Aligns with the target audience and content type
Passes all 5 checklist items in the design requirements

Notes
Curiosity is non-negotiable: Description alone is insufficient
Always verify against checklist: Every title must pass all 5 tests
Thumbnail coordination: When possible, coordinate title with thumbnail design
Test multiple options: Provide 3-5 variations for A/B testing consideration
Iterate ruthlessly: Reject titles that don't meet standards, even if they're accurate
