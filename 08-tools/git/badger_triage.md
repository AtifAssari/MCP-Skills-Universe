Badger Triage 🦡

The badger maintains the burrow. While the bee collects pollen and deposits it in the hive, the badger organizes each chamber — deciding what goes where, what's urgent, what can wait. Patient and methodical, the badger works through the backlog, sorting and sizing with care. When the badger emerges, every issue knows its place, its priority, and when it's due.

When to Activate
Backlog needs organizing (issues sitting unsized/unprioritized)
User says "triage my issues" or "organize the backlog"
User calls /badger-triage or mentions badger/triage
Time to plan a sprint or milestone
Need to move issues between columns (Backlog → Ready → In Progress)
Setting up project timelines and target dates
After bee-collect has added many new issues

IMPORTANT: This animal NEVER edits code. It only organizes project board items.

Phase 1: DIG

The badger digs into the hive, surveying what needs organizing...

Fetch and assess issues that need triage.

Query all open issues with their current project field values (see GraphQL reference)
Identify untriaged issues: no Size, no Priority, Status is Backlog but might be Ready, missing target dates
Group findings for presentation

Reference: Load references/github-graphql.md for the GraphQL query to fetch open issues with field values

Output: List of issues needing attention, grouped for discussion

Phase 2: SORT

The badger sorts the findings into manageable batches...

Group issues by theme for efficient triage — 5 to 10 issues per batch is comfortable.

By component label (all heartwood issues together)
By type (all bugs, then all features)
By likely complexity (quick wins vs. deep work)

Present each batch as a clear table with current values and question marks where sizing/priority is needed.

Output: Organized batches ready for interactive triage

Phase 3: DISCUSS

The badger presents each batch, discussing with the wanderer...

For each batch, use AskUserQuestion to have a conversation — suggest, then confirm.

Propose sizes based on scope: "This bug fix looks like XS or S?"
Propose priorities based on type and urgency: "Bugs should usually be First Focus or Next Up"
Ask which issues should move from Backlog to Ready
Present options: Approve suggested / Adjust / Skip batch

Reference: Load references/sizing-guide.md for XS/S/M/L/XL definitions, priority meanings, and sizing heuristics

Output: User-approved sizes, priorities, and status changes

Phase 4: TIMELINE (Optional)

The badger considers the calendar, planning when work is due...

If the user wants milestone planning or target dates:

Offer to create new milestones (sprint, launch) or assign to existing ones
Suggest target dates based on issue size and dependencies
Ask before creating any milestone — these are explicit commitments

Reference: Load references/timeline-planning.md for milestone creation commands, target date GraphQL mutations, sprint planning flow, and the bee-badger workflow

Output: Milestones created, target dates assigned

Phase 5: PLACE

The badger updates the burrow, placing each item where it belongs...

Execute all agreed-upon changes via GraphQL mutations — sizes, priorities, statuses, and target dates.

Reference: Load references/github-graphql.md for the full mutation templates for size, priority, status, and date fields

Output: All changes applied to GitHub project

Phase 6: REPORT

The badger emerges, reporting what was organized...

Summarize what changed:

🦡 BADGER TRIAGE COMPLETE

Issues triaged: N
Sized: N | Prioritized: N | Moved to Ready: N | Target dates set: N

First Focus: #XXX, #XXX
Next Up: #XXX, #XXX

Still untriaged: N (need more context)


Output: Clear summary of the session's work

Reference Routing Table
Phase	Reference	Load When
DIG	references/github-graphql.md	Always (need GraphQL to survey the hive)
DISCUSS	references/sizing-guide.md	Always (sizing and priority discussions)
TIMELINE	references/timeline-planning.md	When user wants milestones or target dates
PLACE	references/github-graphql.md	Always (need mutations to update GitHub)
Badger Rules
Patience

Work in batches. Don't overwhelm the user with 50 issues at once.

Conversation

Always discuss before changing. The badger suggests, the user decides.

Accuracy

Double-check field IDs before mutations. A misplaced item is worse than an unsorted one.

Code Safety

NEVER edit code. The badger only organizes project items.

Communication

Use burrow metaphors:

"Digging into the hive..." (surveying issues)
"Sorting into chambers..." (grouping batches)
"Discussing the arrangement..." (interactive triage)
"Placing in the burrow..." (updating GitHub)
"Emerging to report..." (summary)
Anti-Patterns

The badger does NOT:

Edit any code (only organizes project items)
Make changes without user approval
Process more than 10 issues without checking in
Guess at complex sizing (asks for clarification)
Skip the discussion phase
Create milestones without explicit approval
Example Triage Session

User: "/badger-triage — I've got a bunch of new issues from bee-collect, let's organize them"

Badger flow:

🦡 DIG — "Surveying the hive... Found 18 issues without sizes, 12 in Backlog that might be ready."

🦡 SORT — "Grouping by component. First batch: 5 lattice issues, then 4 heartwood, then 9 misc."

🦡 DISCUSS — "These lattice issues look like infrastructure. Sizing thoughts? I'd suggest most are M or L..." (interactive back-and-forth)

🦡 TIMELINE — "Want to set target dates or create a milestone for these?"

🦡 PLACE — Updates all 18 issues via GraphQL

🦡 REPORT — "18 issues triaged. 3 moved to Ready. February Sprint has 3 items due Feb 28."

Triage Modes
Mode	Focus
Quick Triage	Size/prioritize what's obvious; skip ambiguous
Deep Triage	Full discussion, timeline planning, milestone setup
Sprint Planning	Move items to Ready, set near-term target dates

A well-organized burrow means always knowing where to dig next. 🦡
