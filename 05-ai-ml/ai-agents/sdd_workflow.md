IF A SPEC EXISTS, YOU MUST READ IT BEFORE WRITING CODE. IF NO SPEC EXISTS FOR BEHAVIOR CHANGE, YOU MUST CREATE ONE FIRST.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

This skill IS the SDD pipeline. Reference it once in CLAUDE.md — you do NOT need to list individual steps. The decision tree, phase detection, and transition rules below handle all routing.

Instruction Priority
User's explicit instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) — highest priority
OpenSpec artifacts (proposal.md, specs/, design.md, tasks.md) — the authoritative spec baseline
SDD workflow skills — route and enforce process
Default system prompt — lowest priority

If the user says "skip the spec, just write code," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

SDD Workflow — Spec-Driven Development Router
The Rule

Before any code, human and AI agree on what to build. Specifications are files in openspec/. Every behavior change is traceable from proposal through archive.

Request Classification

When the user brings a development request, classify FIRST. Then route.

digraph sdd_routing {
    "User request received" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Is it a one-line fix?\n(typo, log line, comment)" [shape=diamond];
    "Make change,\nverify directly" [shape=box];
    "Is it a bug with\nunclear cause?" [shape=diamond];
    "superpowers:systematic-debugging\n(root cause first)" [shape=box];
    "Are there OpenSpec\nartifacts already?" [shape=diamond];
    "Read existing artifacts,\npick up where left off" [shape=box];
    "Is the requirement\nclearly bounded?" [shape=diamond];
    "Unfamiliar codebase\nor uncertain approach?" [shape=diamond];
    "/opsx:propose\n(generate 4 artifacts)" [shape=box];
    "/opsx:explore\n(build context first)" [shape=box];
    "superpowers:brainstorming\n(Socratic design)" [shape=box];
    "Route to execution\n(sdd-review-specs →\nwriting-plans → apply)" [shape=doublecircle];

    "User request received" -> "Is it a one-line fix?\n(typo, log line, comment)";
    "Is it a one-line fix?\n(typo, log line, comment)" -> "Make change,\nverify directly" [label="yes"];
    "Is it a one-line fix?\n(typo, log line, comment)" -> "Is it a bug with\nunclear cause?" [label="no"];
    "Is it a bug with\nunclear cause?" -> "superpowers:systematic-debugging\n(root cause first)" [label="yes"];
    "Is it a bug with\nunclear cause?" -> "Are there OpenSpec\nartifacts already?" [label="no"];
    "Are there OpenSpec\nartifacts already?" -> "Read existing artifacts,\npick up where left off" [label="yes"];
    "Are there OpenSpec\nartifacts already?" -> "Is the requirement\nclearly bounded?" [label="no"];
    "Is the requirement\nclearly bounded?" -> "Unfamiliar codebase\nor uncertain approach?" [label="yes, but\nneeds exploration"];
    "Is the requirement\nclearly bounded?" -> "/opsx:propose\n(generate 4 artifacts)" [label="yes, clear\nboundaries"];
    "Unfamiliar codebase\nor uncertain approach?" -> "/opsx:explore\n(build context first)" [label="need to read\ncode first"];
    "Unfamiliar codebase\nor uncertain approach?" -> "superpowers:brainstorming\n(Socratic design)" [label="greenfield\nor approach\ncomparison"];
    "/opsx:propose\n(generate 4 artifacts)" -> "Route to execution\n(sdd-review-specs →\nwriting-plans → apply)";
    "/opsx:explore\n(build context first)" -> "Is the requirement\nclearly bounded?";
    "superpowers:brainstorming\n(Socratic design)" -> "Is the requirement\nclearly bounded?";
    "Make change,\nverify directly" -> "Route to execution\n(sdd-review-specs →\nwriting-plans → apply)" [style=invis];
}

Phase Detection

Check the file system to determine where you are in the workflow:

What exists	Phase	Next action
No openspec/ directory	Uninitialized	Run openspec init first
openspec/ exists, no change dir	Ready for proposal	/opsx:propose <name> or exploration
openspec/changes/<name>/ with 4 artifacts, unreviewed	Specs need review	Tier 1: self-review inline (2-5 min). Tier 2: sdd-review-specs full gate. Default Tier 2 if unsure.
openspec/changes/<name>/ with reviewed artifacts	Ready for execution	superpowers:writing-plans
tasks.md has unchecked items	In progress	/opsx:apply + superpowers:test-driven-development
All tasks checked, not archived	Ready for delivery	superpowers:verification-before-completion → /opsx:archive
Tool Selection Matrix

When both OpenSpec and Superpowers offer a tool for the same phase, use this:

Scenario	Use This	Not That	Why
Reading existing code, finding patterns	/opsx:explore	@brainstorming	Explore reads code; brainstorming generates ideas
Defining new feature from scratch	@brainstorming	/opsx:explore	Brainstorming compares approaches; explore describes existing state
Generating spec artifacts	/opsx:propose	@writing-plans	Propose creates the 4-artifact structure; writing-plans refines granularity
Refining task granularity	@writing-plans	Manual only	Writing-plans converts coarse tasks to 2-5min bite-sized units
Executing tasks	/opsx:apply + @test-driven-development	Either alone	Apply is the scheduler; TDD is the executor. Pipeline them.
Debugging failures	@systematic-debugging	Direct fixes	Root cause investigation first. Never trial-and-error.
Code review	@requesting-code-review + @receiving-code-review	"Looks good to me"	Structured review with independent context
Claiming completion	@verification-before-completion	"Should work now"	Fresh verification evidence required
Archiving completed work	/opsx:archive	Manual file moves	Archive does delta merge + timestamp + project.md update
Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP — you're rationalizing skipping the SDD process:

Thought	Reality
"This is simple, I don't need a spec"	Simple changes cause complex bugs. A 5-line proposal.md saves hours.
"I'll write the spec after the code"	Specs-after describe what you built, not what's needed. They don't align.
"The spec is in the conversation history"	Conversation history evaporates. Files persist. Write it down.
"I already know what to build"	Knowing ≠ having it reviewed. Specs are the agreement, not the idea.
"Specs slow me down"	Rework from misaligned expectations is slower. Align first, execute second.
"This is just a prototype"	Prototypes become production. Spec now saves migration pain later. "Prototype" is a scope label in proposal.md — it doesn't exempt you from writing specs/, design.md, and tasks.md.
"I'll just explore the codebase first"	Use /opsx:explore — structured exploration with output. Don't browse aimlessly.
"Let me check a few files quickly"	That's what /opsx:explore does systematically. Use the tool.
"I remember how this codebase works"	Code evolves. Your memory is stale. Read the specs.
"One more task before reviewing"	Review gate exists for a reason. Skipping it accumulates unchecked assumptions.
"The tasks.md checklist IS the review"	tasks.md tracks implementation progress. sdd-review-specs validates scope, design, and completeness. These are different activities — checking boxes is not reviewing specs. The review gate has a 7-step function (identify tier, read artifacts, check against checklist, communicate issues, iterate, declare pass, route). Skipping it is non-compliance.
"I'll review as I implement"	Review-after-implementation finds what you built, not what you need. The gate must be BEFORE code — catching scope and design issues after implementation costs 10x more to fix.
"The real risk is the deadline, not the spec"	Risk inversion. Skipping the spec is the deadline risk — unreviewed changes cause the incidents that blow deadlines.
"A minimal proposal is good enough"	Partial compliance is non-compliance. The SDD pipeline produces 4 artifacts for a reason. A proposal without specs/design/tasks is a wish, not a plan.
"Can't spec what I don't understand yet"	That's what /opsx:explore is for. Build understanding first, then spec. Never invert the order — code is not exploration.

All of these mean: follow the SDD process. No shortcuts.

Skill Types

SDD workflow is a RIGID skill. Follow the routing exactly. Don't adapt away the sequence.

The tools it routes to have their own types:

@test-driven-development, @systematic-debugging, @verification-before-completion — Rigid. Follow exactly.
@brainstorming, @writing-plans, /opsx:explore — Flexible. Adapt principles to context.
/opsx:propose, /opsx:apply, /opsx:archive — Rigid. These are CLI tools with defined behavior.
Transition Rules

After each phase completes, route to the next:

Phase complete → check what's next:

/opsx:propose done      → DETERMINE TIER, then route:
  Tier 0 (typo/log/comment)   → skip /opsx:propose entirely — make change and verify directly
  Tier 1 (single field, config)→ self-review inline: check proposal.md scope boundary
                                 and tasks.md executability. Skim design.md for obvious
                                 conflicts with existing architecture. 2-5 min.
                                 Then proceed to implementation.
  Tier 2 (new feature, refactor)→ HARD STOP. Invoke sdd-review-specs full gate function.
                                 Produce review.md. Do NOT proceed until it passes.
                                 Self-review via tasks.md checkboxes is NOT review for Tier 2.
  When in doubt, default to Tier 2. Over-reviewing is cheaper than missing a critical issue.
sdd-review-specs passed → superpowers:writing-plans (refine task granularity)
writing-plans done      → /opsx:apply + superpowers:test-driven-development (pipeline)
                          OR superpowers:subagent-driven-development (parallel tasks)
                          OR superpowers:executing-plans (batch execution)

During apply:
  - Error/failure → superpowers:systematic-debugging → return to apply
  - All tasks done → superpowers:verification-before-completion

verification-before-completion passed → /opsx:archive
/opsx:archive done → commit → push → done

The Bottom Line

Specs before code. Review before execution. Evidence before completion.

The SDD process exists because AI programming without a spec layer drifts. Each phase produces a file in openspec/ — that file is the agreement. Honor it.
