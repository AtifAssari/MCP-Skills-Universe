Usage
/capacity-plan $ARGUMENTS

What I Need From You
Team size and roles: Who do you have?
Current workload: What are they working on? (Upload from project tracker or describe)
Upcoming work: What's coming next quarter?
Constraints: Budget, hiring timeline, skill requirements
Planning Dimensions
People
Available headcount and skills
Current allocation and utilization
Planned hires and timeline
Contractor and vendor capacity
Budget
Operating budget by category
Project-specific budgets
Variance tracking
Forecast vs. actual
Time
Project timelines and dependencies
Critical path analysis
Buffer and contingency planning
Deadline management
Utilization Targets
Role Type	Target Utilization	Notes
IC / Specialist	75-80%	Leave room for reactive work and growth
Manager	60-70%	Management overhead, meetings, 1:1s
On-call / Support	50-60%	Interrupt-driven work is unpredictable
Common Pitfalls
Planning to 100% utilization (no buffer for surprises)
Ignoring meeting load and context-switching costs
Not accounting for vacation, holidays, and sick time
Treating all hours as equal (creative work ≠ admin work)

Tips
Include all work — BAU, projects, support, meetings. People aren't 100% available for project work.
Plan for buffer — Target 80% utilization. 100% means no room for surprises.
Update regularly — Capacity plans go stale fast. Review monthly.
