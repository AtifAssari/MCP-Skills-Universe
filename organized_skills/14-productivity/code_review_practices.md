Code Review Practices Skill
Purpose

Establishes effective code review practices that improve code quality, share knowledge, catch bugs early, and maintain security standards while fostering collaborative development culture.

Rules
Code Review Principles (MUST Follow)

Core Principles:

1. Respectful Communication
   - Focus on code, not the person
   - Ask questions, don't make demands
   - Provide constructive suggestions
   - Acknowledge good work

2. Timeliness
   - Review within 24 hours
   - Small PRs reviewed faster
   - Block releases for critical issues only
   - Don't let PRs go stale

3. Thoroughness
   - Understand the context
   - Test the changes locally
   - Check for side effects
   - Verify all review points

4. Continuous Learning
   - Explain reasoning behind feedback
   - Share knowledge and best practices
   - Learn from others' approaches
   - Iterate on review process

Review Process

Pull Request Author:

Before Requesting Review:
1. Self-review your changes
2. Run tests locally
3. Run linter/formatter
4. Write clear PR description
5. Link related issues
6. Tag appropriate reviewers
7. Mark as draft if work-in-progress

PR Description Template:
## Changes
- [Bullet list of changes made]

## Why
[Explanation of motivation]

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Screenshots (if UI changes)
[Before/after screenshots]

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guide
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No secrets committed


Reviewer:

Review Steps:
1. Read PR description and linked issues
2. Understand the context and goals
3. Review code changes in logical order
4. Check out branch and test locally
5. Run automated checks (tests, linter)
6. Leave inline comments for specific issues
7. Provide summary comment
8. Approve, Request Changes, or Comment

Comment Types:
- **MUST FIX**: Blocking issue (security, bug, breaking)
- **SHOULD FIX**: Important but not blocking
- **NIT**: Nitpick, style preference
- **QUESTION**: Clarification needed
- **SUGGESTION**: Alternative approach
- **PRAISE**: Good work, clever solution

Feedback Guidelines

Effective Comments:

❌ BAD: "This is wrong."
✅ GOOD: "This could cause a race condition when multiple users 
         access the cache simultaneously. Consider using a lock
         or atomic operation."

❌ BAD: "Why did you do it this way?"
✅ GOOD: "Have you considered using Array.map() here? It might be
         more readable and is functionally equivalent."

❌ BAD: "This is terrible naming."
✅ GOOD: "Could we rename 'tmp' to 'temporaryUserData' for clarity?
         It would help future maintainers understand the purpose."


Praise Effectively:

✅ "Great use of dependency injection here! Makes this very testable."
✅ "I like how you extracted this into a separate function. Much cleaner."
✅ "Excellent test coverage of edge cases!"
✅ "This optimization is impressive. Nice catch!"

Code Review Anti-Patterns

AVOID:

1. Rubber Stamping
   - Approving without thorough review
   - "LGTM" without understanding changes
   - Skipping testing locally

2. Nitpicking Without Value
   - Focusing only on style (use automated tools)
   - Personal preferences without reasoning
   - Arguing about subjective choices

3. Review Hostility
   - Hostile or condescending tone
   - Dismissing author's approach without discussion
   - Making it personal

4. Perfectionism
   - Holding up PR for minor issues
   - Requesting unnecessary refactors
   - Scope creep in review

5. Review Overload
   - PRs too large to review effectively
   - Too many reviewers required
   - Review fatigue

Pull Request Size Guidelines

MUST:

Target Sizes:
- Small: < 200 lines changed (ideal)
- Medium: 200-500 lines (acceptable)
- Large: 500-1000 lines (split if possible)
- XL: > 1000 lines (must split)

For Large Changes:
1. Break into smaller, logical PRs
2. Use feature flags for incremental merges
3. Create base branch for related PRs
4. Document overall design in RFC/issue

Exceptions (acceptable large PRs):
- Generated code
- Configuration updates
- Dependency bumps
- Data migrations

Security-Focused Review

MUST CHECK:

Authentication & Authorization:
✓ Authentication required for protected endpoints
✓ Authorization checks before resource access
✓ No role/permission bypass vulnerabilities
✓ Session management secure

Input Validation:
✓ All user input validated
✓ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
✓ XSS prevention (output encoding)
✓ Path traversal prevention
✓ File upload validation

Sensitive Data:
✓ No secrets in code
✓ No API keys committed
✓ Sensitive data encrypted at rest
✓ PII handled per GDPR
✓ Secure logging (no passwords/tokens in logs)

Dependencies:
✓ npm audit / pip-audit passed
✓ No known vulnerable dependencies
✓ Dependencies from trusted sources
✓ Lock files updated

Example Security Comment:
"⚠️ SECURITY: This endpoint allows unauthenticated access to user
data. We need to add authentication middleware and verify the user
has permission to access this resource. See access-control SKILL.md
for implementation pattern."

Examples
Exemplary Review Comments

Functionality Issue:

🐛 **Bug**: This will fail when `user.profile` is null. We should add
a null check or use optional chaining:

const email = user.profile?.email || 'no-email@example.com';

This handles the null case gracefully and prevents runtime errors.


Performance Suggestion:

⚡ **Performance**: This loops through users twice (filter then map).
We could combine into a single pass:

const activeUserEmails = users
  .filter(u => u.active)
  .map(u => u.email);

Could become:

const activeUserEmails = users.reduce((emails, u) => {
  if (u.active) emails.push(u.email);
  return emails;
}, []);

Though honestly, for small arrays the original is more readable. What's
the expected size of the users array?


Security Issue:

🔒 **SECURITY**: This SQL query is vulnerable to injection:

const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;

We must use parameterized queries:

const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1';
const result = await db.query(query, [email]);

See our secure-development SKILL.md for more examples.


Praise:

✨ Really nice abstraction here! Extracting this logic into a reusable
utility function makes it testable and DRY. The naming is also very
clear. Great work! 🎉
