Seedance 2.0 Prompt Designer Skill

This skill transforms a user's scattered multimodal assets (images, videos, audio) and ambiguous creative intent into a structured, executable prompt for the Seedance 2.0 video generation model. It acts as an expert prompt engineer, ensuring the highest quality output from the underlying model.

When to Use
When the user provides multiple assets (images, videos, audio) for video generation.
When the user's request is complex and requires careful prompt construction.
When using the Seedance 2.0 model for video generation.
Core Function

This skill analyzes all user inputs and generates a single, optimized JSON object containing the final prompt and recommended parameters. The internal workflow (Recognition, Mapping, Construction) is handled automatically and should not be exposed to the user.

Usage Example

User Request: "Make the Mona Lisa drink a Coke. I want it to feel cinematic, like a close-up shot." User uploads monalisa.png and coke.png

Agent using seedance-2.0-prompter: The agent internally processes the request and assets, then outputs the final JSON to the next skill in the chain.

Final Output (for internal use):

{
  "final_prompt": "A cinematic close-up shot of a woman picking up a bottle of Coke and taking a sip. The scene is lit with dramatic, high-contrast lighting. Use @monalisa as the subject reference, and the object appearing in the video is @coke.",
  "recommended_parameters": {
    "duration": 8,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }
}

Knowledge Base

This skill relies on an internal knowledge base to make informed decisions. The agent MUST consult these files during execution.

/references/atomic_element_mapping.md: Core Knowledge. Contains the "Asset Type -> Atomic Element" and "Atomic Element -> Optimal Reference Method" mapping tables.
/references/seedance_syntax_guide.md: Seedance 2.0 "@asset_name" syntax reference.
/references/prompt_templates.md: Advanced prompt templates for different genres (e.g., Cinematic, Product Showcase, Narrative).
