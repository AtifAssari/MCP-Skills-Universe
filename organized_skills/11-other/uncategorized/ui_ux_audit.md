UI/UX Audit Skill
🚨 CRITICAL: This Skill Runs BEFORE Implementation

Purpose: Prevent redundant implementations and cluttered designs by auditing current state FIRST.

When to invoke: Automatically when user mentions:

UI/UX work: "improve UI", "enhance UX", "better design", "update layout"
Page work: "fix homepage", "improve page", "update interface", "redesign"
Visual changes: "add visual elements", "enhance visuals", "improve appearance"
Component work: "add component", "new feature", "improve section"
General improvements: "make it better", "improve experience", "enhance site"

Order of execution:

✅ This skill runs FIRST (audit phase)
Then present findings to user
Then optionally invoke ui-ux-designer agent (design critique)
Then implement approved changes
Mandatory Audit Process (READ FIRST, IMPLEMENT SECOND)
Step 1: Read Current State (Non-Negotiable)

Before making ANY recommendations, read these files:

# Target page file
Read: src/app/[target-page]/page.tsx

# Related components (if modifying existing sections)
Read: src/components/sections/[component].tsx

# Related data files
Read: src/data/[related-data].tsx
Read: src/data/page-content/[page]-content.ts

# Check for existing similar functionality
Grep: Search for keywords related to proposed feature


Example:

User: "Improve homepage"

MUST READ FIRST:
- src/app/page.tsx
- src/components/sections/Hero.tsx
- src/data/page-content/home-content.ts

THEN analyze what EXISTS before proposing anything

Step 2: Document What EXISTS (Evidence-Based)

Create inventory of current state:

## Current State Audit: [Page Name]

### Existing Components
- Component 1: [Description, location, purpose]
- Component 2: [Description, location, purpose]

### Existing Data Display
- Portfolio metrics: [Where shown, format]
- CTAs: [Location, text, purpose]
- Content sections: [List all sections]

### Design Characteristics
- Layout: [Grid, flex, columns]
- White space: [Generous, tight, balanced]
- Information density: [Minimal, moderate, dense]
- Visual style: [Clean, busy, colorful, minimal]

### Evidence
[Show actual code snippets proving what exists]

Step 3: Redundancy Check (Critical)

Before proposing ANY addition, verify:

 Is this data already displayed elsewhere on the page?
 Does similar functionality exist in different form?
 Would this duplicate existing content?
 Would this clutter a clean design?
 Is information shown more than once?

Anti-Patterns to Avoid (from October 2025 lessons):

❌ Portfolio Visualization when impact cards already show portfolio breakdown ❌ Large AI Assistant card when primary CTAs already exist in hero ❌ Metric sidebars on document-style pages (like /brief) ❌ Dashboards on intentionally minimal pages (like /ai-lab) ❌ Duplicate data displays in multiple sections ❌ Bulk additions without clear value proposition

Step 4: Identify GENUINE Gaps (Not Assumed Gaps)

Only propose additions for:

✅ Missing functionality (proven by code audit) ✅ Genuine UX problems (demonstrated, not assumed) ✅ Clear value add (specific benefit articulated) ✅ Respects clean design (doesn't add bulk)

Template:

## Genuine Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: [Specific missing element]
- Evidence: [Code shows this doesn't exist]
- User need: [Why user needs this]
- Value: [Specific benefit]
- Simple solution: [Minimal approach]
- No redundancy: [Confirmed doesn't duplicate X]

### Gap 2: [Next gap]
...

Step 5: Design Philosophy Check

This portfolio has a CLEAN, MINIMAL aesthetic by design:

Check against these principles:

 Simple, scannable layouts
 Strategic use of white space
 Information shown ONCE, not repeated
 Document-style pages stay document-like
 No bulk additions without clear need

Questions to ask:

Does this ADD value or just ADD BULK?
Is this the SIMPLEST solution?
Does this respect the existing clean design?
Would this survive user review or get reverted?
Audit Output Template

Present findings in this format:

# UI/UX Audit Report: [Page Name]

## Current State Summary
[2-3 sentences describing current design]

## What Already EXISTS
1. [Component/feature]: [Description with code location]
2. [Component/feature]: [Description with code location]
3. [Component/feature]: [Description with code location]

Evidence: [Code snippets proving these exist]

## Redundancy Check Results
✅ No redundancy detected: [Explain]
OR
⚠️ Potential redundancy: [Show what duplicates what]

## Genuine Gaps Identified
### Priority 1: [Most important gap]
- Evidence: [Why this is missing]
- User impact: [Specific problem it solves]
- Proposed solution: [Minimal approach]
- No redundancy: [Confirmed]

### Priority 2: [Next gap]
...

## NOT Recommended (Would Create Redundancy)
❌ [Proposed feature]: Already exists as [existing feature]
❌ [Proposed feature]: Would duplicate [existing data]

## Design Philosophy Compliance
✅ Respects clean, minimal aesthetic
✅ Adds value without adding bulk
✅ No information duplication
OR
⚠️ Concerns: [List any design philosophy violations]

## Recommendation
**Recommended:** Implement Priority 1 gap ([brief description])
**Not Recommended:** [List features that would add redundancy]

**Next Steps:**
1. User review of findings
2. (Optional) Invoke ui-ux-designer agent for design critique
3. Implement approved changes incrementally

Verification Checklist

Before completing audit, verify:

 Did I read all target page/component files FIRST?
 Did I document what EXISTS (not what I assume is missing)?
 Did I check for redundancy systematically?
 Did I identify GENUINE gaps (not assumed gaps)?
 Did I verify no information duplication?
 Does recommendation respect clean, minimal design?
 Did I propose SIMPLEST solution?
 Would this survive user review?

If any answer is NO, STOP and reassess.

Example: Good vs. Bad Audit
❌ BAD Audit (What NOT to do)
User: "Improve homepage"

Bad Response:
"I recommend adding:
1. Portfolio visualization showing $156M breakdown
2. Large dashboard with metrics
3. Section transitions between content
4. Enhanced testimonials with animations"

Problem: Didn't read current state, didn't check for redundancy

✅ GOOD Audit (What TO do)
User: "Improve homepage"

Good Response:
"Let me audit the current homepage first..."

[Reads src/app/page.tsx]

"Current State Audit:

What EXISTS:
- Impact cards already display portfolio breakdown ($156M, $91M, etc.)
- Hero has primary CTAs (View Work, See Skills, Get In Touch)
- Testimonials section exists
- EKG dividers separate sections

Redundancy Check:
⚠️ Adding portfolio visualization would DUPLICATE impact card data

GENUINE Gap:
✅ No CTA after testimonials section (natural conversion point)

Recommendation:
- Add single strategic CTA after testimonials
- Do NOT add portfolio visualization (redundant)
- Keep clean, minimal design

Would you like to proceed with the CTA addition?"

"Should I add X to the page?"
Remember: This Skill Prevents the October 2025 Session Mistakes

What went wrong that day:

Implemented Phase 3 UI/UX recommendations without reading pages
Added PortfolioVisualization despite impact cards showing same data
Added large AI Assistant card overshadowing primary CTAs
Added bulk to AI Lab page making it "look like two pages in one"
User had to revert everything

This skill prevents those mistakes by:

Reading current state FIRST (always)
Checking for redundancy BEFORE proposing
Respecting clean, minimal design philosophy
Identifying genuine gaps (not assumed gaps)
Presenting evidence-based findings to user BEFORE implementing
