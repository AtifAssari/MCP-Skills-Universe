🚨 CRITICAL GUIDELINES
Windows File Path Requirements

MANDATORY: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths

When using Edit or Write tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (\) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (/).

Examples:

❌ WRONG: D:/repos/project/file.tsx
✅ CORRECT: D:\repos\project\file.tsx

This applies to:

Edit tool file_path parameter
Write tool file_path parameter
All file operations on Windows systems
Documentation Guidelines

NEVER create new documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.

Priority: Update existing README.md files rather than creating new documentation
Repository cleanliness: Keep repository root clean - only README.md unless user requests otherwise
Style: Documentation should be concise, direct, and professional - avoid AI-generated tone
User preference: Only create additional .md files when user specifically asks for documentation
Azure Pipelines Best Practices

Comprehensive best practices for creating and maintaining Azure DevOps YAML pipelines.

Pipeline Structure

Multi-Stage Pipelines:

# Recommended structure
stages:
  - stage: Build
  - stage: Test
  - stage: DeployDev
  - stage: DeployStaging  
  - stage: DeployProduction


Benefits:

Clear separation of concerns
Conditional stage execution
Environment-specific configurations
Approval gates between stages
Triggers and Scheduling

Best practices:

Use path filters to avoid unnecessary builds
Enable batch builds for high-frequency repos
Use PR triggers for validation
Schedule nightly/weekly builds for comprehensive testing
trigger:
  batch: true
  branches:
    include: [main, develop]
  paths:
    exclude: ['docs/*', '**.md']

pr:
  autoCancel: true
  branches:
    include: [main]

schedules:
  - cron: '0 0 * * *'
    displayName: 'Nightly build'
    branches:
      include: [main]
    always: false  # Only if code changed

Variable Management

Hierarchy:

Pipeline-level variables (az devops YAML)
Variable groups (shared across pipelines)
Azure Key Vault (secrets)
Runtime parameters (user input)

Security:

Never hardcode secrets
Use Key Vault for sensitive data
Mark secrets in variable groups
Secrets are automatically masked in logs
Caching

Implement caching for:

Package dependencies (npm, pip, NuGet, Maven)
Docker layers
Build outputs

Impact:

Faster builds (up to 90% reduction)
Reduced network usage
Lower costs
Templates

Use templates for:

Reusable build patterns
Standardized deployment steps
Consistent security scanning
Company-wide best practices

Benefits:

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Centralized updates
Consistent processes
Security Practices

Essential:

Code scanning (SAST, dependency)
Container image scanning
Secret scanning
Compliance checks
Branch protection policies
Required approvals
Performance

Optimize:

Parallelize independent jobs
Use caching extensively
Shallow git clones (fetchDepth: 1)
Appropriate agent pools
Clean up artifacts
Monitoring

Track:

Build success rates
Build durations
Test pass rates
Deployment frequency
Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

Always verify best practices against latest Azure DevOps documentation.
