Extract Design Language

Extract the complete design language from any website URL. Generates 8 output files covering colors, typography, spacing, shadows, components, breakpoints, animations, and accessibility.

Prerequisites

Ensure designlang is available. Install if needed:

npm install -g designlang


Or use npx (no install required):

npx designlang <url>

Process
Run the extraction on the provided URL:
npx designlang <url> --screenshots


For multi-page crawling: npx designlang <url> --depth 3 --screenshots For dark mode: npx designlang <url> --dark --screenshots

Read the generated markdown file to understand the design:
cat design-extract-output/*-design-language.md


Present key findings to the user:

Primary color palette with hex codes
Font families in use
Spacing system (base unit if detected)
WCAG accessibility score
Component patterns found
Notable design decisions (shadows, radii, etc.)
