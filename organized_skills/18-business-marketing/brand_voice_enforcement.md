Brand Voice Enforcement

Apply existing brand guidelines to all sales and marketing content generation. Load the user's brand guidelines, apply voice constants and tone flexes to the content request, validate output, and explain brand choices.

Loading Brand Guidelines

Find the user's brand guidelines using this sequence. Stop as soon as you find them:

Session context — Check if brand guidelines were generated earlier in this session (via /brand-voice:generate-guidelines). If so, they are already in the conversation. Use them directly. Session-generated guidelines are the freshest and reflect the user's most recent intent.

Local guidelines file — Check for .claude/brand-voice-guidelines.md inside the user's working folder. Do NOT use a relative path from the agent's current working directory — in Cowork, the agent runs from a plugin cache directory, not the user's project. Resolve the path relative to the user's working folder. If no working folder is set, skip this step.

Ask the user — If none of the above found guidelines, tell the user: "I couldn't find your brand guidelines. You can:

Run /brand-voice:discover-brand to find brand materials across your platforms
Run /brand-voice:generate-guidelines to create guidelines from documents or transcripts
Paste guidelines directly into this chat or point me to a file"

Wait for the user to provide guidelines before proceeding.

Also read .claude/brand-voice.local.md for enforcement settings (even if guidelines came from another source):

strictness: strict | balanced | flexible
always-explain: whether to always explain brand choices
Enforcement Workflow
1. Analyze the Content Request

Before writing, identify:

Content type: email, presentation, proposal, social post, message, etc.
Target audience: role, seniority, industry, company stage
Key messages needed: which message pillars apply
Specific requirements: length, format, tone overrides
2. Apply Voice Constants

Voice is the brand's personality — it stays constant across all content:

Apply "We Are / We Are Not" attributes from guidelines
Use brand personality consistently
Incorporate approved terminology; reject prohibited terms
Follow messaging framework and value propositions

Refer to references/voice-constant-tone-flexes.md for the "voice constant, tone flexes" model.

3. Flex Tone for Context

Tone adapts by content type and audience. Use the tone-by-context matrix from guidelines to set:

Formality: How formal or casual should this be?
Energy: How much urgency or enthusiasm?
Technical depth: How detailed or accessible?
4. Generate Content

Create content that:

Matches brand voice attributes throughout
Follows tone guidelines for this specific content type
Incorporates key messages naturally (not forced)
Uses preferred terminology
Mirrors the quality and style of guideline examples

For complex or long-form content, delegate to the content-generation agent (defined in agents/content-generation.md). For high-stakes content, delegate to the quality-assurance agent (defined in agents/quality-assurance.md) for validation.

5. Validate and Explain

After generating content:

Briefly highlight which brand guidelines were applied
Explain key voice and tone decisions
Note any areas where guidelines were adapted for context
Offer to refine based on feedback

When always-explain is true in settings, include brand application notes with every response.

Handling Conflicts

When the user's request conflicts with brand guidelines:

Explain the conflict clearly
Provide a recommendation
Offer options: follow guidelines strictly, adapt for context, or override

Default to adapting guidelines with an explanation of the tradeoff.

Open Questions Awareness

Open questions are unresolved brand positioning decisions flagged during guideline generation, stored in the guidelines under an "Open Questions" section. When generating content, check if the brand guidelines contain open questions:

If content touches an unresolved open question, note it
Apply the agent's recommendation from the open question unless the user specifies otherwise
Suggest resolving the question if it significantly impacts the content
