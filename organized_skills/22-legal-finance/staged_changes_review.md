Staged Changes Review

Checklist-driven, deterministic review of Git staged changes. Produces reproducible findings by combining grep-based scanning with closed-question semantic analysis.

输出要求

重要：本技能必须使用中文输出所有分析结果和建议。

语言: 始终使用中文回复
编码: UTF-8
风格: 专业、简洁，发现必须附带代码证据
Workflow (8 Steps)

Execute steps in strict order: 0 → 0.5 → 1 → 2 → 2.5 → 3 → 4 → 5. Do not skip or reorder any step.

Step 0: Collect Changes
git diff --cached
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached --name-status


If no staged changes exist, output "无暂存变更，审查终止。" and stop.

Step 0.5: Detect Project Profile

Detect the project type once to determine which rule categories to activate.

# Detect framework
python3 -c "
import json, sys
try:
    with open('package.json') as f:
        d = json.load(f)
    deps = {**d.get('dependencies', {}), **d.get('devDependencies', {})}
    if 'next' in deps:
        print('react-nextjs')
    elif 'react' in deps:
        print('react-app')
    else:
        print('generic')
except:
    print('generic')
" 2>/dev/null || echo "generic"

# Count staged file types
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -cE '\.(tsx|jsx)$' || echo 0
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -cE '\.py$' || echo 0


Record the detected profile — it determines active rule categories:

Profile	Condition	Active Rule Categories
react-nextjs	next in dependencies	SEC + REACT + PERF + ASYNC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO
react-app	react but no next	SEC + REACT + ASYNC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO (001-007)
python-generic	Python files majority, no package.json	SEC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO (001-006)
generic	No package.json or detection failed	SEC + STR + LOGIC/BREAK + BIZ + REPO (001-006)

REACT-* and PERF-* rules are skipped entirely for python-generic or generic profiles. REPO-007 requires react-nextjs or react-app; REPO-008 requires react-nextjs only. If detection fails, default to generic.

Step 1: Classify Files

Classify every staged file into priority tiers using the rules in references/review-rules.md §1.

Assign each file exactly one priority (P0–P4).
Skip P4 files entirely — do not read or scan them.
Sort remaining files by priority (P0 first, P3 last).
Record the file list for the report's "审查范围" section.
Step 2: Deterministic Scan

For each file (P0 → P3 order), execute every applicable deterministic rule from references/review-rules.md §2.

Execution method:

Use grep patterns from references/language-patterns.md matching the file's language.
Run each grep against the staged diff (git diff --cached -- <file>) or the file itself.
If a pattern matches, record a finding immediately — no subjective filtering.
Use the severity from references/review-rules.md §4 — do NOT modify severity.

MANDATORY: Every rule × file combination must be executed or explicitly marked N/A (wrong file type or inactive profile). Do not skip rules because "they seem unlikely."

Step 2.5: Impact Scope Analysis

For P0/P1 files, run a one-time impact scope assessment and record results for the "影响范围" section.

# 1. New/modified exported symbols in staged diff
git diff --cached -U0 -- "*.ts" "*.tsx" | grep -E "^\+export (function|const|class|interface|type)"

# 2. API route changes
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "app/api/|pages/api/"

# 3. Server Action changes (security impact)
git diff --cached -- "*.ts" "*.tsx" | grep -E '^[+-].*("use server"|'"'"'use server'"'"')'

# 4. Environment variable changes
git diff --cached -- ".env*" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "^[+-][A-Z_]+" | head -10


For each exported symbol found (up to 5 symbols), check reference count:

# Replace SYMBOL_NAME with actual symbol
grep -rl "SYMBOL_NAME" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l


If no impact scope items are detected, note "无显著影响范围变更" in the report.

Step 3: Semantic Review

For each file (P0 → P3 order), answer every applicable semantic question from references/review-rules.md §3 and §3b.

Execution method:

Read the file's staged diff and surrounding context (use Read tool for full file when needed).
For each semantic rule, answer the closed question with exactly one of:
YES — issue found. MUST provide: file:line + evidence snippet.
NO — reviewed, no issue found.
N/A — rule does not apply to this file type or change.
Only YES answers produce findings. Use the severity from §4.

BIZ 规则执行说明:

对 P1 文件，使用 git show HEAD:<path> 获取变更前版本，与暂存版本对比进行 before/after 行为分析。
BIZ findings 必须包含"变更前行为"、"变更后行为"和"影响场景"字段。
纯重构（逻辑等价变换）不应报为行为变更。
采样限制: P1 文件超过 10 个时，BIZ 规则仅分析前 5 个文件，并注明"剩余 N 个文件未进行 BIZ 分析（采样限制）"。

MANDATORY: Answer every question. Do not skip questions because context seems insufficient — answer N/A with a brief reason instead.

Step 4: Merge & Deduplicate
Collect all findings from Steps 2 and 3.
Generate a fingerprint for each finding: {ruleId}:{file}:{line}.
Deduplicate by fingerprint — if the same fingerprint appears from both a deterministic and semantic rule, keep the one with higher severity.
Group findings by severity: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW.
Apply output budget limits from references/report-template.md §3.
Step 5: Generate Report

Output the report using the exact structure from references/report-template.md §2.

审查范围: file counts and rule counts.
影响范围: impact scope analysis results.
业务影响分析: BIZ findings 的摘要表格（变更文件 / BIZ 规则 / 行为变更摘要）。若无 BIZ 发现，输出"未检测到用户可感知的业务行为变更"。
发现总览: severity summary table.
结论: auto-select from references/review-rules.md §5 based on highest severity found.
分级发现: findings in references/report-template.md §1 format, grouped by severity. BIZ findings 按 severity 归入对应级别。
文件审查矩阵: per-file summary table.
Execution Constraints (MANDATORY)

These constraints are non-negotiable. Violating any constraint invalidates the review.

No skipping: Every rule must be evaluated against every applicable file. Document N/A explicitly.
No free-form analysis: Only report findings that match a defined rule ID. Do not invent new categories.
Forced answers: Every semantic question must receive YES, NO, or N/A. Leaving a question unanswered is forbidden.
Evidence lock: Every YES finding must cite a specific file:line and include a code snippet. Findings without evidence are invalid.
Severity is immutable: Use the severity from the mapping table. Do not upgrade or downgrade based on subjective judgment.
Conclusion is templated: The conclusion must be one of the four templates in review-rules.md §5. Do not write a custom conclusion.
Fingerprint required: Every finding must include a fingerprint in {ruleId}:{file}:{line} format.
Context Budget Strategy

When staged changes are large (>500 lines or >15 files):

P0 files: Always read full content — security-critical.
P1 files: Read full diff. If a single file diff >200 lines, focus on: function signatures, exported symbols, error handling blocks, and security-sensitive patterns.
P2 files: Read diff only. Focus on SEC rules and BREAK-003/BREAK-004.
P3 files: Scan diff headers only. Apply STR rules only.
If total context would exceed capacity, process files strictly by priority and stop at capacity with a note: "剩余 N 个低优先级文件未审查".

REACT/ASYNC rule sampling limit: For rules that require Read tool for semantic verification (REACT-001, REACT-003, ASYNC-001, ASYNC-002), if grep returns more than 5 matches, take the first 5 matches only and note "N 处未验证（采样限制）". This prevents excessive Read tool calls.

Validator Interface Contract

This skill's output is consumed by staged-review-validator. The following fields are required for compatibility:

Finding title must include [ruleId] prefix (e.g., [SEC-003] SQL 拼接风险)
Each finding must include a 指纹 (Fingerprint) field
Severity uses 4 levels: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
Report structure follows references/report-template.md §2
BIZ-* findings 使用 before/after 格式（含"变更前行为"、"变更后行为"、"影响场景"字段），详见 references/report-template.md §1
