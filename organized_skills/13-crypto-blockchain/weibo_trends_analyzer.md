Weibo Trends Analyzer - 微博热搜创意产品分析
Overview

This skill helps you identify creative product opportunities from Weibo trending topics. It fetches real-time hot search data, researches comprehensive background information, evaluates product development potential, and presents findings in an interactive dashboard.

Keywords: Weibo, 微博, trending topics, hot search, 热搜, product ideas, creative products, market analysis, social media trends, Chinese market

Workflow
1. Fetch Weibo Trending Topics

Default API: https://apis.tianapi.com/weibohot/index?key=4dfdf794141101d7bb8ece0294dbbc02

When the user requests Weibo trending analysis, fetch the current hot search list:

curl -s "https://apis.tianapi.com/weibohot/index?key=4dfdf794141101d7bb8ece0294dbbc02"


API Response Processing:

The API returns data in this format:

{
  "code": 200,
  "msg": "success",
  "result": {
    "list": [
      {
        "hotword": "trending keyword",
        "hotwordnum": "1234567",
        "hottag": "新/热/荐"
      }
    ]
  }
}


Field Mapping:

hotword → Trending keyword (热搜关键词)
hotwordnum → Heat value (热度值), may contain category prefix like "综艺 587870"
hottag → Tag (标签): "新"(new), "热"(hot), "荐"(recommended), or empty
Ranking position → Inferred from array index (1-based)

Parsing Instructions:

Check if code == 200 to confirm success
Extract the result.list array
For each item in the list:
Rank = array index + 1
Keyword = hotword
Heat value = extract numeric value from hotwordnum (remove category prefix if present)
Tag = hottag
Category = extract from hotwordnum prefix if exists (e.g., "综艺", "剧集", "盛典", "演出")
Limit analysis to top 10-15 items to manage processing time

Error Handling:

If API fetch fails, follow this fallback strategy:

API Returns Error Code (code ≠ 200):

Log the error message from API response
Inform user: "API returned error: {msg}. Would you like to use mock data instead?"
Suggest checking API key or quota limits
If user agrees, use .claude/skills/weibo-trends-analyzer/weibo-mock-data.json

Network/Connection Failure:

Inform user: "Unable to connect to API. Possible network issue."
Offer to use mock data: .claude/skills/weibo-trends-analyzer/weibo-mock-data.json
Suggest verifying internet connection

Invalid JSON Response:

Log the response received
Inform user: "API returned invalid data format"
Recommend checking if API endpoint has changed
Fall back to mock data if available

Empty or Malformed Data:

If result.list is empty or missing
Inform user: "No trending topics found in API response"
Use mock data as fallback
2. Deep Research Each Trending Topic

For EACH trending topic, perform 2 focused web searches to gather essential background:

Search Strategy (2 searches per topic):

Search 1: Context & Background Combine social media discussions and news background in one search:

Search query examples:
"{keyword} 微博 新闻背景"
"{keyword} 热搜原因 讨论"
"{keyword} latest news 用户看法"

Goal: Understand WHAT the trend is about and WHY it's trending

Search 2: User Insights & Market Potential Focus on consumer perspective and product opportunities:

Search query examples:
"{keyword} 用户需求 产品"
"{keyword} 消费者痛点"
"{keyword} 产品创意 市场"

Goal: Identify user needs, pain points, and product development opportunities

Information to Extract: From the 2 searches, gather:

✅ Social media sentiment and discussion volume (社交媒体讨论)
✅ News background and event context (新闻背景)
✅ Target demographics and audience size (目标人群)
✅ User pain points and unmet needs (用户痛点)
✅ Existing products or market gaps (市场机会)
✅ Cultural/social significance (文化意义)

Error Handling for Web Searches:

Search Returns No Results:

Log: "No search results for: {keyword}"
Mark research as "Limited data available"
Proceed with analysis using keyword itself and general market knowledge
Note in dashboard: "⚠️ 背景研究受限"

Search Timeout or Failure:

Retry once with simplified query (just keyword without additional terms)
If retry fails, mark as "Search unavailable"
Continue analysis with available data
Note limitation in product analysis

Irrelevant Search Results:

If results don't match trending topic context:
Try alternative search query with different keywords
Use general industry knowledge for analysis
Document: "Based on general market analysis"

Partial Search Success (1 of 2 succeeds):

Proceed with available search data
Note which aspect is missing (context vs. user insights)
Make conservative estimates for missing information
Mark in dashboard with: "⚠️ 部分数据"
3. AI-Powered Product Ideation & Scoring

For each trending topic, analyze and generate creative product ideas using this scoring framework:

Scoring System (Total: 100 Points)

Product Development Potential (可发展度): 40 points

Market size and scalability (15 points)
Technical feasibility (10 points)
Trend longevity vs. fleeting fad (10 points)
Competitive landscape (5 points)

Interest Level (有趣度): 20 points

Creative uniqueness (10 points)
Emotional appeal (5 points)
Share-ability/viral potential (5 points)

Practical Life Utility (生活有用度): 20 points

Daily life integration (10 points)
Problem-solving capability (5 points)
Target audience size (5 points)

Small-Scale Production Ease (小规模生产容易程度): 20 points

Manufacturing complexity (10 points)
Material accessibility (5 points)
Cost efficiency for small batches (5 points)

Product Concept Requirements:

For each trend, generate 1-3 creative product concepts including:

Market Category (市场赛道): Which product category (e.g., home decor, fashion accessories, stationery, tech gadgets, lifestyle products, toys, etc.)
Product Name (产品名称): Catchy, memorable name
Target Audience (销售对象人群): Specific demographic (age, interests, income level, lifestyle)
