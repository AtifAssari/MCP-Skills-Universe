Margin Management
Purpose

Monitor and manage margin-living strategy by tracking margin balances, interest costs, dividend coverage ratios, and portfolio-to-margin safety thresholds. Provides data-driven scaling recommendations based on strategy milestones.

When to Use

Use this skill when:

Importing new Fidelity balances CSV
Updating margin balance or interest rate
Calculating coverage ratio (dividends ÷ interest)
User mentions: "margin dashboard", "margin balance", "coverage ratio", "margin strategy"
Assessing margin scaling decisions
Checking safety thresholds
Core Workflow
1. Read Fidelity Balances CSV

Location: notebooks/updates/Balances_for_Account_{account_id}.csv

Key Fields to Extract:

Balance,Day change
Total account value,228809.41,3447.61      → Portfolio Value
Margin buying power,193919.92,-4667.04
Net debit,-2992.70,-2191.14                 → Margin Balance (abs value)
Margin interest accrued this month,1.12,    → Monthly Interest (actual)


Calculations:

Margin Balance: Absolute value of "Net debit" = $2,992.70
Interest Rate: Default 10.875% (Fidelity $1k-$24.9k tier) unless specified
Monthly Interest Cost: Balance × Rate ÷ 12 = $2,992.70 × 0.10875 ÷ 12 = $27.11
2. Safety Check: Margin Jump Alert

Rule: If new margin balance > previous balance + $5,000, STOP

Reason: Large draws should be intentional per margin-living strategy

Example:

Previous: $2,992.70
Current: $9,500.00 (+$6,507.30) → 🚨 ALERT - Confirm intentional draw


Action:

Alert user immediately
Show diff: "Margin increased by $6,507 - Confirm this was intentional"
Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
3. Add Entry to Margin Dashboard

Insert new row with:

Date: Current date (use date +"%Y-%m-%d")
Margin Balance: From Balances CSV (Net debit absolute value)
Interest Rate: 10.875% (or updated rate from CSV if available)
Monthly Interest Cost: Calculate (Balance × Rate ÷ 12)
Notes: Auto-generate based on elapsed time since Oct 9, 2025

Example Entry:

Date: 2025-11-11
Margin Balance: $2,992.70
Interest Rate: 10.875%
Monthly Interest Cost: $27.11
Notes: Month 1 - Building foundation, on track per strategy


Notes Generation Logic:

months_elapsed = (current_date - datetime(2025, 10, 9)).days // 30

if months_elapsed < 6:
    note = f"Month {months_elapsed} - Building foundation, on track per strategy"
elif months_elapsed < 12:
    note = f"Month {months_elapsed} - Approaching Month 6 milestone"
elif months_elapsed < 18:
    note = f"Month {months_elapsed} - Approaching break-even milestone"
else:
    note = f"Month {months_elapsed} - Mature strategy, monitor scaling"

4. Update Summary Section

Recalculate Dashboard Metrics:

Current Margin Balance
= Latest entry from Margin Dashboard
Example: $2,992.70

Monthly Interest Cost
= Latest calculated cost
Example: $27.11/month

Annual Interest Cost
= Monthly Interest Cost × 12
Example: $27.11 × 12 = $325.32/year

Dividend Income (from Dividend Tracker)
= Pull from Dividend Tracker "TOTAL EXPECTED DIVIDENDS"
Example: $2,847.32/month

Coverage Ratio
= Dividend Income ÷ Monthly Interest Cost
Formula: =IFERROR(Dividends / Interest, 0)
Example: $2,847.32 ÷ $27.11 = 105.0x 🟢


Fix #DIV/0! if margin balance = $0:

Before: =B10 / B11  (causes #DIV/0! when margin = 0)
After: =IFERROR(B10 / B11, 0)  (returns 0 when no margin)

5. Calculate Strategy Metrics
Portfolio-to-Margin Ratio
= Total account value ÷ Margin Balance
Example: $228,809.41 ÷ $2,992.70 = 76.5:1 🟢🟢🟢


Safety Thresholds:

🟢 Green: Ratio > 4.0:1 (target - healthy margin usage)
🟡 Yellow: Ratio 3.5-4.0:1 (warning - pause scaling)
🔴 Red: Ratio < 3.0:1 (alert - stop draws, inject business income)
⚫ Critical: Ratio < 2.5:1 (emergency - inject $30k+, consider selling)
Current Draw vs Fixed Expenses
Current monthly draw: $4,500 (fixed expenses only)
Target: Start with $4,500, scale to $6,213, $8,000, $10,000 based on data

6. Scaling Alerts (Time-Based)

Strategy Start Date: October 9, 2025

Calculate months elapsed:

from datetime import datetime
start = datetime(2025, 10, 9)
current = datetime.now()
months_elapsed = (current - start).days // 30

Month 6 Alert (April 2026)
📊 MONTH 6 MILESTONE CHECK:
✅ Dividends: $2,847/month (need $2,000+)
✅ Portfolio-to-Margin Ratio: 76.5:1 (need 4:1+)
✅ Dividend Growth: On track

🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Scale margin draw to $6,213/month (add mortgage)
- Current: $4,500 (fixed expenses only)
- New: $6,213 (fixed + mortgage)
- Safety margin: Excellent

Month 12 Alert (October 2026)
📊 MONTH 12 BREAK-EVEN CHECK:
Expected Dividends: $4,500+/month (goal: break-even with margin interest)
✅ IF achieved: Consider scaling to $8,000/month (add some variable expenses)
⚠️ IF not: Hold at $6,213, assess strategy

Month 18 Alert (April 2027)
📊 MONTH 18 MATURE STRATEGY CHECK:
Expected Dividends: $7,000+/month
Expected Margin: Declining (dividends paying down debt)
✅ IF achieved: Consider scaling to $10,000/month (most variable expenses)
⚠️ IF not: Hold current level, reassess timeline

7. Alert Thresholds

Generate alerts based on conditions:

Green (Healthy)
✅ Ratio > 4:1 AND dividends covering interest
Status: On track, continue per strategy

Yellow (Caution)
⚠️ Ratio 3.5-4:1 OR dividend coverage declining
Action: Pause scaling, monitor weekly

Red (Alert)
🚨 Ratio < 3:1 OR dividend cuts detected
Action: STOP draws, inject $20k business income

Critical (Emergency)
⛔ Ratio < 2.5:1 OR margin call risk
Action: STOP draws, inject $30k+ business income, consider selling hedge (SQQQ)

Critical Rules
WRITABLE Columns (Margin Dashboard)
✅ Date (Column A)
✅ Margin Balance (Column B)
✅ Interest Rate (Column C)
✅ Monthly Interest Cost (Column D - calculated but writeable)
✅ Notes (Column E)
SACRED Formulas (NEVER TOUCH)
❌ Coverage Ratio (unless adding IFERROR wrapper)
❌ Summary section totals (unless fixing #DIV/0!)
Margin Strategy Philosophy

Core Principle: Confidence-based scaling, not time-based mandates

Decision Framework:

Data-driven: Decisions backed by actual dividend income, not projections
Safety-first: Never scale if ratio drops below 3.5:1
Business income as insurance: Available $22k/month, not primary strategy
Monte Carlo backstop: 98.5% of scenarios used business income at some point
Business Income Backstop

Available: $22,000/month from business operations

Usage Scenarios:

⛔ Margin call (ratio < 3:1): MUST USE business income immediately
⚠️ Market correction (20-30% drop): OPTIONAL - assess need
🎯 Acceleration (reach FI faster): OPTIONAL - strategic choice

Current Philosophy: Insurance policy only, not active strategy component

Example Calculations

Ratio: 11.2:1 🟢

Monthly Interest: $227
Dividend Income: $4,500 (projected)
Coverage: 19.8x 🟢

Status: Healthy - on track for break-even

Scenario 3: Month 15 (Break-Even)
Portfolio Value: $350,000
Margin Balance: $50,000 (scaled to $8,000/month draw)
Ratio: 7.0:1 🟢

Monthly Interest: $453
Dividend Income: $6,800
Coverage: 15.0x 🟢

Status: Break-even achieved, dividends > interest
