Version: 3.0 Source: Architecture Principles + Project Structure Profiles

How to structure a project — both logically (module design, dependency flow) and physically (folder layout, naming, type-specific conventions).

The Problem

AI agents don't remember where they put things last session. Without explicit structure, each session invents its own folder layout, module boundaries, and dependency patterns — leading to scattered files, circular imports, and architectures that only make sense to the session that created them. These standards define one structure so every session builds in the same place.

Consumption
Builders: Read ## Builder Checklist before creating files or folders. Follow the project type profile that matches your target.
Refactorers: Use ## Enforced Rules to find structural violations. Read narrative sections for migration guidance.
Both: Narrative sections are the authoritative standard. Checklist and rules table are compressed views of the same content.
Scope and Boundaries

This skill covers: Module design, dependency flow, folder structure, naming conventions, and project-type-specific layouts.

This skill does NOT cover: Code quality within files (see code-quality), documentation standards (see documentation), or build/deploy configuration.

Relationship to other skills:

Works alongside code-quality (file-level conventions) and documentation (docs standards)

Goal: Small changes stay local.

A typical feature should touch 1-2 modules, ship quickly, and not require coordinated edits across the system. If you find yourself editing 5+ files across multiple layers for a simple change, that's a design smell.

Core Principles
1. Explicit Over Magic

Prefer readable wiring over convention-heavy frameworks. When someone reads your code, the control flow should be obvious. No @AutoInject() decorators that hide what depends on what — use explicit constructor parameters.

2. Boundaries Are Sacred

Modules communicate only through contracts (APIs, props, events). No reaching into another module's internals. Import from the module's public API, never from internal files.

3. Own Your Data

Each module owns its schema/state. Other modules read via APIs or props, never direct access. If OrderModule needs user data, it calls UserModule.getUserById() — it doesn't query the users table directly.

4. Optimize for Refactoring

If code is hard to move or rename, it's a design smell. Loose coupling enables safe refactoring.

The 3 Layers
01-presentation/  →  02-logic/  →  03-data/

Layer	Responsibility	Examples
Presentation	What users see and interact with	Components, pages, styles
Logic	How it's built, business rules	Services, use cases, validation
Data	How it persists, external sources	Repositories, models, adapters
Valid Dependency Flow
Presentation → Logic → Data ✅
Data → Logic ❌ (blocked)
Logic → Presentation ❌ (blocked)
Presentation → Data ❌ (blocked — no layer skipping)

Module Boundaries

A module is a cohesive unit with a clear public API, hidden implementation, and defined dependencies.

Module Rules

Single Entry Point: Each module exposes its API through an index file. External imports MUST go through it.

No Circular Dependencies: Modules cannot depend on each other in a cycle. Break cycles by extracting shared code, using events, or introducing an interface.

Own Your Data: Each module owns its data exclusively. Cross-module data is accessed via APIs, never direct DB queries.

Coupling Guidelines
Coupling Type	OK?
Type import	Always
Function call via public API	Usually
Direct instantiation	Carefully
Shared mutable state	Avoid

Folder Structure

A well-organized project isn't just tidy — it's a project where you never have to ask "where does this go?" or "where would I find that?" The structure itself answers those questions. When folders mirror how you think about the project, navigation becomes intuitive rather than a search exercise. You find things where you expect them to be, on the first try.

This matters even more when AI is involved. AI has no memory between sessions — it can't learn your project's layout over time the way a human teammate would. Every session starts fresh. A clear, predictable structure means the AI spends less time searching and more time doing useful work. Descriptive folder names, consistent conventions, and logical grouping are context that the AI reads for free on every interaction.

The goal: any file should be findable in 2-3 navigation steps based on intuition alone. If you have to search, the structure failed.

Organize by Feature Within Tiers

For web projects using 3-tier architecture, organize by feature WITHIN each tier — don't scatter a single feature across global models/, services/, controllers/ directories.

Within 02-logic/:
Prefer:                          Avoid:
02-logic/                        02-logic/
  users/                           models/
    user.model.ts                    user.model.ts
    user.service.ts                  order.model.ts
  orders/                          services/
    ...                              user.service.ts
                                     order.service.ts


Feature-based grouping keeps related code together within each tier. Tiers enforce dependency flow (presentation → logic → data), while feature folders enforce cohesion within each tier. These are complementary, not contradictory.

For non-web projects (CLI tools, libraries, scripts) that don't use 3-tier architecture, apply feature-based grouping at the project root level.

Universal Structural Principles

These apply to every project regardless of type.

Naming Consistency — Pick one casing convention per category and apply it everywhere. All components PascalCase, all utilities camelCase, all configs kebab-case. Consistency makes things findable — when you know the convention, you can predict the file name before you look.

Logical Grouping — Related files live together. If you change one, you'll likely change the others. Co-locate by default. Only separate when there's a clear benefit. The test for grouping: "If I'm working on X, what else will I need open?"

Reasonable Depth — No more than 4 levels from root to file. Every level of nesting must earn its place. If a folder contains only one subfolder containing one file — flatten it. Deep nesting isn't organization, it's a scavenger hunt.

Clear Entry Point — Someone opening the project for the first time should know where to start within 10 seconds. Root README explains what the project is. The main entry file is named conventionally (index, main, app). Top-level folders tell the story of what the project is.

Clean Root — The project root should contain only what must be there — entry points, top-level config, and the folders that define the project's structure. Config files that must live at root (.gitignore, package.json, tsconfig.json) get a pass — stray scripts, utilities, and one-off files do not. When in doubt, move it deeper. The root is the first impression.

Self-Documenting Names — Folder names describe what's inside, not how it's used. formatters/, validators/, parsers/ are clear. utils/, helpers/, misc/ are dumping grounds. If a folder has more than 10 files with no shared theme, split by what the files actually do.

Project Type Profiles

Type-specific folder structures, naming conventions, and red flags. Each profile is a self-contained reference.

Detection Decision Tree
Does the project contain...

  ├─ package.json + .tsx/.jsx/.css/.html files?
  │  └─ YES → Load references/web.md
  │
  ├─ Assets/ + .cs scripts + .unity scene files?
  │  ├─ VRChat SDK present? (Packages/com.vrchat.*, VRCSDK3, UdonSharp)
  │  │  └─ YES → Load references/vrchat.md (overrides Unity)
  │  └─ No VRC SDK
  │     └─ Load references/unity.md
  │
  ├─ .blend files + texture images?
  │  └─ YES → Load references/blender.md
  │
  ├─ .tf files / cdk.json / template.yaml?
  │  └─ YES → Load references/data-iac.md
  │
  └─ None of the above?
     └─ Use Universal Structural Principles above


Priority rule: When multiple profiles match, use the most specific. VRChat overrides Unity. A project with both application code and IaC should use the application profile for the app and reference data-iac for the infrastructure portion.

Available Profiles
Profile	Reference File	Best For
Web (React/Node)	references/web.md	SPAs, fullstack apps, Node APIs, React projects
Unity	references/unity.md	Unity games, tools, non-VRChat Unity projects
VRChat	references/vrchat.md	VRChat worlds and avatars (extends Unity)
Blender	references/blender.md	3D modeling, texturing, rendering projects
Data/IaC (AWS)	references/data-iac.md	Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation infrastructure

Pattern Selection
Pattern	Use When
Pure functions	Stateless transformations
Module with functions	Grouping related functions
Class	State or DI needed
Factory	Complex object creation
Repository	Data access abstraction

Default to simplicity: Function → Module → Class → Pattern

Full catalog: references/design-patterns.md — Factory, Builder, Adapter, Facade, Decorator, Strategy, Observer, Command, Repository, Result Type

Testing Strategy
Type	Purpose	Scope	Volume
Unit	Fast, deterministic, domain-heavy	Single function/component	Heavy
Integration	DB, APIs, external services	Module boundaries	Moderate
E2E	Critical user paths only	Full stack	Minimal

Heavy unit tests, moderate integration, minimal E2E. E2E sprawl leads to brittle, slow test suites. Contract tests recommended for API boundaries.

Anti-Patterns
Code Architecture
Anti-Pattern	Symptom	Fix
God Object	>500 lines, >10 public exports	Extract cohesive submodules
Anemic Domain Model	Getters/setters only, services do all work	Move behavior to entities
Shotgun Surgery	Adding a field requires 5+ file changes	Better encapsulation
Project Structure
Anti-Pattern	Symptom	Fix
Cluttered Root	15+ files at project root, stray scripts alongside config	Move everything that isn't an entry point or required config into folders
God Folder	One folder with 40+ files	Group by domain, feature, or function
Ghost Folders	Empty folders with no files and no clear purpose	Delete unless part of an intentional pattern
Naming Soup	Mixed casing: UserProfile.tsx, order-utils.ts, payment_service.py	Pick one convention per file type, enforce it
Orphaned Files	Files that nothing imports or references	Verify unused, then delete
Deep Nesting	5+ folder levels to reach a single file	Flatten — levels should reflect real boundaries
Mirror Trees	src/ and tests/ with identical structures	Co-locate unit tests with source; separate tree only for integration/E2E
Config Explosion	10+ config files at root	Consolidate where possible, move to config/
When to Extract

Start with a modular monolith (single deployable, clean internal boundaries).

Extract to separate services only when:

Reason	Example
Scale	One part needs independent scaling
Team	Separate teams need independent deploy cycles
Technology	A component needs a different runtime/language

Don't extract for "cleanliness" — that adds operational complexity without benefit.

Observability Basics

Structured Logging: JSON, not string concatenation. Include context ({ userId, timestamp }), not messages ('User ' + userId + ' logged in').

Correlation IDs: Track requests across async operations.

Error Boundaries: Catch and report, don't swallow silently.

Decision Records

For significant architectural choices, document: Context (problem), Decision (what we chose), Alternatives (what else we considered), Consequences (trade-offs).

Location: Documentation/decisions/

Template: assets/decision-record-template.md

Scaling Principles
Project Size	Focus On
Small	North Star, Red Flags
Growing	Add Testing Strategy, Observability
Team	Add Decision Records, Module Ownership
Red Flags

Stop and reconsider when you see:

Smell	Problem	Fix
shared/common/utils dumping ground	Ownership unclear, grows forever	Move to owning module or create focused package
Cross-module direct imports	Tight coupling	Use APIs, events, or props
Direct database access across modules	Hidden dependencies	Build a read API or service
"Quick helper" in wrong module	Boundary violation	Move to correct owner
Framework magic hiding control flow	Hard to debug, hard to refactor	Make it explicit
Feature touching 5+ unrelated files	Poor separation	Refactor boundaries
Builder Checklist

Before designing modules or folder structure, verify your plan against these constraints. Builders read this section before writing code; refactorers use the Enforced Rules table and full narrative instead.

Structure
 3-tier architecture: 01-presentation/ → 02-logic/ → 03-data/
 No reverse dependencies (data → logic, logic → presentation)
 No layer skipping (presentation → data)
 Max 4 folder levels from root to file
 Clean root — only entry points and required config at top level
Modules
 Each module has a single entry point (index file)
 No circular dependencies between modules
 Each module owns its data — no cross-module direct DB access
 Feature-organized within tiers (not global models/, services/ folders)
Design
 Default to simplicity: function → module → class → pattern
 Small changes stay local (feature touches 1-2 modules, not 5+)
 No shared/common/utils dumping grounds
 Folder names describe what's inside (not helpers/, misc/)
Enforced Rules

These rules are deterministically checked by check.js (clean-team). When updating these standards, update the corresponding check.js rules to match — and vice versa.

Rule ID	Severity	What It Checks
tier-imports	error	Imports that violate 01→02→03 dependency direction
tier-structure	error	Missing or incomplete 3-tier folder structure in web projects
