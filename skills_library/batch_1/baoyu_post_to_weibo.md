Two posting modes: regular posts (text with up to 18 images/videos) and long-form headline articles with Markdown input

SKILL.md

Prerequisites
Google Chrome or Chromium

${BUN_X} {baseDir}/scripts/weibo-post.ts "Hello Weibo!" --image ./photo.png
${BUN_X} {baseDir}/scripts/weibo-post.ts "Watch this" --video ./clip.mp4


Parameters:

Parameter	Description
<text>	Post content (positional)
--image <path>	Image file (repeatable)
--video <path>	Video file (repeatable)
--profile <dir>	Custom Chrome profile

Note: Script opens browser with content filled in. User reviews and publishes manually.

Headline Articles (头条文章)

Long-form Markdown articles published at https://card.weibo.com/article/v3/editor.

${BUN_X} {baseDir}/scripts/weibo-article.ts article.md
${BUN_X} {baseDir}/scripts/weibo-article.ts article.md --cover ./cover.jpg


Parameters:

Parameter	Description
<markdown>	Markdown file (positional)
--cover <path>	Cover image
--title <text>	Override title (max 32 chars, truncated if longer)
--summary <text>	Override summary (max 44 chars, auto-regenerated if longer)
--profile <dir>	Custom Chrome profile

Frontmatter: title, summary, cover_image supported in YAML front matter.

Character Limits:

Title: 32 characters max (truncated with warning if longer)
Summary/导语: 44 characters max (auto-regenerated from content if longer)

Markdown-to-HTML: Do NOT pass any --theme parameter when converting markdown to HTML. Use the default theme (no theme argument).

Article Workflow:

Opens https://card.weibo.com/article/v3/editor
Clicks "写文章" button, waits for editor to become editable
Fills title (validated for 32-char limit)
Fills summary/导语 (validated for 44-char limit)
Inserts HTML content into ProseMirror editor via paste
Replaces image placeholders one by one (copy image → select placeholder → paste)

Post-Composition Check: The script automatically verifies after all images are inserted:

Remaining WBIMGPH_ placeholders in editor content
Expected vs actual image count

If the check fails (warnings in output), alert the user with the specific issues before they publish.

Post Type Selection

Unless the user explicitly specifies the post type:

Markdown file (.md) → Headline Article (头条文章)
Plain text / text with images → Regular Post
Troubleshooting
Chrome debug port not ready

If a script fails with Chrome debug port not ready or Unable to connect, kill only the CDP Chrome instances (those with --remote-debugging-port AND the baoyu-skills profile), then retry:

pkill -f "remote-debugging-port.*baoyu-skills/chrome-profile" 2>/dev/null; sleep 2


CRITICAL: Never kill all Chrome processes (pkill -f "Google Chrome"). Only kill Chrome instances launched by CDP with the baoyu-skills profile directory. The user may have regular Chrome windows open.

Important: This should be done automatically -- when encountering this error, kill the CDP Chrome instances and retry the command without asking the user.

Notes
First run: manual login required (session persists)
All scripts only fill content into the browser, user must review and publish manually
Cross-platform: macOS, Linux, Windows
Extension Support

Custom configurations via EXTEND.md. See Preferences section for paths and supported options.
