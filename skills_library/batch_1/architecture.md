Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) or evaluate a system design.

Usage
/architecture $ARGUMENTS

Modes

Create an ADR: "Should we use Kafka or SQS for our event bus?" Evaluate a design: "Review this microservices proposal" System design: "Design the notification system for our app"

See the system-design skill for detailed frameworks on requirements gathering, scalability analysis, and trade-off evaluation.

Tips
State constraints upfront — "We need to ship in 2 weeks" or "Must handle 10K rps" shapes the answer.
Name your options — Even if you're leaning one way, I'll give a more balanced analysis with explicit alternatives.
Include non-functional requirements — Latency, cost, team expertise, and maintenance burden matter as much as features.
