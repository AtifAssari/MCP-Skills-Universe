Webflow Browser API

The Browser API is a JavaScript interface exposed via the global wf object on all Webflow sites with Analyze and Optimize enabled. It requires no manual installation. Use it to manage consent, track experiments, and personalize user experiences.

Key Concepts
Global wf object — Automatically available on all sites with Analyze or Optimize enabled
wf.ready() — All Browser API calls must be wrapped in this readiness callback. See references/wf-ready.md
Consent management — Three methods to manage tracking consent: getUserTrackingChoice(), allowUserTracking(), denyUserTracking()
Variations — Track experiment results via onVariationRecorded() and forward to analytics tools
Custom attributes — Set visitor attributes via setAttributes() for audience targeting and result filtering (Enterprise only)
API Methods
Method	Description
wf.ready(callback)	Execute code after the Browser API loads
wf.getUserTrackingChoice()	Returns "allow", "deny", or "none"
wf.allowUserTracking(options?)	Opt user into tracking
wf.denyUserTracking(options?)	Opt user out of tracking
wf.onVariationRecorded(callback)	Register a callback for variation events
wf.setAttributes(scope, attributes)	Set custom visitor attributes
Important Notes
The Browser API is only available on sites with Webflow Analyze or Optimize enabled
Custom JavaScript attributes (setAttributes) are only available on Enterprise sites
Always wrap all API calls inside wf.ready() to prevent calls before initialization
Place scripts in <head> custom code for earliest possible execution
