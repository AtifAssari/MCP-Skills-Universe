Formula Protection
Purpose

GUARDRAIL SKILL - Prevents accidental modification or deletion of critical formulas that maintain spreadsheet integrity. Ensures financial data accuracy by protecting auto-calculated columns.

When to Use (Auto-Blocks)

This skill automatically blocks when detecting:

Attempts to "update formula", "modify formula", "change formula"
Editing Column C (GOOGLEFINANCE price formulas)
Modifying Columns D-F, H-S (calculated formulas)
Fixing formula errors (#N/A, #DIV/0!, #REF!) without proper protocol
User mentions: "fix formula", "edit cell", "update column C/D/E"

This is a BLOCKING skill - You MUST use this skill before proceeding with any formula-related edits.

Sacred Formulas (NEVER TOUCH)
DataHub Tab

Column C: Last Price

=GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price")

Auto-updates stock prices in real-time
❌ NEVER modify - prices must come from Google Finance
❌ NEVER replace with static values
✅ ONLY wrap with IFERROR if showing #N/A for delisted stocks

Columns D-E: $ Change, % Change

=C2 - G2  ($ Change)
=D2 / G2  (% Change)

Calculated from Last Price (C) and Avg Cost Basis (G)
❌ NEVER touch - let formulas calculate automatically

Columns H-M: Gains/Losses

=L2 - M2  (Total G/L $)
=K2 / M2  (Total G/L %)
=B2 * C2  (Current Value)
=B2 * G2  (Cost Basis Total)

Core portfolio performance metrics
❌ NEVER modify - accuracy depends on these formulas
✅ ONLY add IFERROR if #DIV/0! errors appear

Columns N-S: Advanced Metrics

Contains ranges, dividend data, layer classifications
Mix of formulas and manual classifications
⚠️ Consult spreadsheet-architecture.md before editing
Dividend Tracker Tab

Column F: Total Dividend $

=D2 * E2  (Shares × Dividend Per Share)

Calculates expected dividend income per fund
❌ NEVER modify - must remain formula-driven

Total Row Formula

=SUM(F2:F50)  (TOTAL EXPECTED DIVIDENDS)

Sums all dividend income
❌ NEVER delete or modify
✅ ONLY expand range if data grows beyond row 50
Margin Dashboard Tab

Coverage Ratio

=IFERROR(B10 / B11, 0)  (Dividends ÷ Interest Cost)

Critical safety metric for margin strategy
❌ NEVER remove IFERROR wrapper
✅ ONLY update if adding new safety thresholds
Allowed Operations
✅ SAFE: Add IFERROR() Wrappers

Purpose: Prevent error display without changing logic

Example:

Before: =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price")
After: =IFERROR(GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price"), "N/A")

Before: =B10 / B11
After: =IFERROR(B10 / B11, 0)


When to use:

#N/A errors from delisted stocks (GOOGLEFINANCE failures)
#DIV/0! errors when margin balance = $0
#REF! errors from deleted rows (use IFERROR as temporary fix)
✅ SAFE: Fix Broken Sheet References

Purpose: Correct renamed or moved sheet names

Example:

Before: =Sheet1!A1
After: ='DataHub'!A1

Before: ='Dividend Tracker OLD'!B10
After: ='Dividend Tracker'!B10


When to use:

Sheet was renamed (Sheet1 → DataHub)
Sheet was duplicated and old reference remains
Tab moved to different position
✅ SAFE: Expand Formula Ranges

Purpose: Include new data rows without changing logic

Example:

Before: =SUM(F2:F50)
After: =SUM(F2:F100)

Before: =AVERAGE(B2:B30)
After: =AVERAGE(B2:B50)


When to use:

New portfolio positions added beyond row 50
Dividend tracker grows beyond expected size
Margin dashboard accumulates monthly entries
✅ SAFE: Fix Cell Reference Typos

Purpose: Correct obvious mistakes in formula construction

Example:

Before: =B100 * C100  (B100 doesn't exist)
After: =B10 * C10

Before: =A2 + A2  (duplicate cell reference)
After: =A2 + B2  (correct cells)


When to use:

Formula references non-existent row
Clear typo in cell reference
Formula clearly broken due to manual error
Forbidden Operations
❌ NEVER: Change Formula Logic

Example of what NOT to do:

❌ =SUM(F2:F50) → =AVERAGE(F2:F50)  (changes meaning)
❌ =B2 * C2 → =B2 + C2  (changes calculation)
❌ =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price") → =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "volume")


Why: Changes the meaning of calculated data, breaks dashboard integrity

❌ NEVER: Replace Formulas with Static Values

Example of what NOT to do:

❌ =GOOGLEFINANCE("TSLA", "price") → 445.47  (hardcoded)
❌ =B2 * C2 → 32964.78  (static value)
❌ =SUM(F2:F50) → 2847.32  (loses dynamic calculation)


Why: Data becomes stale, no longer updates automatically

❌ NEVER: Delete Formulas

Example of what NOT to do:

❌ Deleting Column C (Last Price formulas) to "clean up"
❌ Removing total row formulas to "simplify"
❌ Clearing formula cells to "start fresh"


Why: Destroys data pipeline, breaks all dependent calculations

❌ NEVER: Modify GOOGLEFINANCE Parameters

Example of what NOT to do:

❌ =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price") → =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "closeyest")
❌ =GOOGLEFINANCE("TSLA", "price") → =GOOGLEFINANCE("NASDAQ:TSLA", "price")


Why: May break price lookups, change data source unexpectedly

Smart Formula Repair Workflow
Step 1: Identify Error Type

Scan spreadsheet for:

#N/A (not available - usually GOOGLEFINANCE or VLOOKUP failures)
#DIV/0! (division by zero - usually margin calculations when balance = $0)
#REF! (reference error - deleted rows/columns)
#VALUE! (wrong data type - rare in financial sheets)
Step 2: Classify Repair Strategy
For #N/A Errors:

GOOGLEFINANCE failures (Column C):

Cause: Stock delisted, ticker invalid, or Google Finance API issue
Solution: Wrap with IFERROR()
=IFERROR(GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price"), "DELISTED")


VLOOKUP failures (if used):

Cause: Lookup value doesn't exist in source data
Solution: Check source data exists, expand range, or add IFERROR()
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, Data!A:B, 2, FALSE), "NOT FOUND")

For #DIV/0! Errors:

Margin coverage ratio (when margin = $0):

Before: =B10 / B11
After: =IFERROR(B10 / B11, 0)


Percentage calculations (when denominator = 0):

Before: =K2 / M2
After: =IFERROR(K2 / M2, 0)

For #REF! Errors:

Deleted rows/columns:

Cause: Formula references Sheet1!A10 but row 10 was deleted
Solution: If temporary, wrap with IFERROR(). If permanent, reconstruct formula.
Temporary: =IFERROR(Sheet1!A10, 0)
Permanent: Identify correct new reference and update

Step 3: Test Repair on Single Cell

Before applying broadly:

Copy original formula to notes (for rollback)
Apply repair to ONE cell
Verify result looks correct
Check no new errors introduced
If successful, apply to other similar errors
Step 4: Validate No New Errors

After repair:

Scan entire sheet for new #N/A, #DIV/0!, #REF!
Verify totals still sum correctly
Check formulas still reference correct cells
Confirm no unexpected data changes
Step 5: Document Repair

Log all changes:

✅ Fixed #DIV/0! in Margin Dashboard C10 by adding IFERROR()
Formula change: =B10/B11 → =IFERROR(B10/B11, 0)
Reason: Margin balance was $0 causing division by zero
Date: 2025-11-11

Pre-Flight Checklist (Before Editing Formulas)

Ask yourself:

 Am I trying to modify a formula-based column? (C, D-F, H-S)
 Is this a GOOGLEFINANCE formula? (STOP - don't touch)
 Is this a total/summary formula? (STOP - don't touch)
 Am I changing formula logic? (STOP - forbidden)
 Am I replacing formula with static value? (STOP - forbidden)
 Am I adding IFERROR to existing formula? (✅ Allowed)
 Am I fixing a broken sheet reference? (✅ Allowed)
 Am I expanding a range for new data? (✅ Allowed)
 Have I consulted spreadsheet-architecture.md? (Required)

If ANY stop condition triggered: Use this skill, review rules, proceed with caution

Emergency Rollback Procedure

If formula modification breaks the spreadsheet:

STOP immediately - Do not attempt additional fixes
Alert user - Clearly explain what went wrong
Document the error:
Which cell/column was modified
What formula change was made
What error occurred (new #N/A, wrong calculations, etc.)
Restore from Google Sheets version history:
File → Version History → See Version History
Find last working version (before modification)
Click "Restore this version"
Learn from it - Update this skill if new edge case discovered
Example Scenarios
❌ WRONG: Modifying Last Price Formula

User request: "The price for TSLA isn't updating, let me fix the formula"

Agent response:

🛑 BLOCKED by formula-protection skill

You're attempting to modify Column C (Last Price) which contains GOOGLEFINANCE formulas.
These are sacred formulas and must NEVER be modified.

If TSLA price isn't updating, the issue is likely:
1. Google Finance API delay (wait 5-10 minutes)
2. Market is closed (prices only update during trading hours)
3. Ticker symbol incorrect (verify "TSLA" is correct)

❌ Do NOT modify =GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price")
✅ If truly broken, wrap with: =IFERROR(GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, "price"), "N/A")

✅ RIGHT: Adding IFERROR Wrapper

User request: "Column C shows #N/A for delisted stock, can you fix?"

Agent response:

✅ Using formula-protection skill

I'll safely wrap the GOOGLEFINANCE formula with IFERROR() to handle the delisted stock.

Before: =GOOGLEFINANCE(A45, "price")
After: =IFERROR(GOOGLEFINANCE(A45, "price"), "DELISTED")

This preserves the formula logic while displaying "DELISTED" instead of #N/A.
The formula will still work if the stock relists in the future.

✅ Safe operation - formula logic unchanged

✅ RIGHT: Expanding Summary Range

User request: "Total dividends formula only goes to row 50, but I have 55 funds now"

Agent response:

✅ Using formula-protection skill

I'll safely expand the SUM range to include all 55 funds.

Before: =SUM(F2:F50)
After: =SUM(F2:F100)

This expands the range to accommodate current data (55 funds) plus room for growth.
Formula logic unchanged - still summing Total Dividend $ column.

✅ Safe operation - range expanded, logic preserved

Google Sheets Integration

Spreadsheet ID: Read from fin-guru/data/user-profile.yaml → google_sheets.portfolio_tracker.spreadsheet_id

Use the mcp__gdrive__sheets tool:

Read-only operations (to detect formula errors):

// STEP 1: Read Spreadsheet ID from user profile
// Load fin-guru/data/user-profile.yaml
// Extract: google_sheets.portfolio_tracker.spreadsheet_id

// STEP 2: Scan for errors
mcp__gdrive__sheets(
    operation: "spreadsheets.values.get",
    params: {
        spreadsheetId: SPREADSHEET_ID,  // from user-profile.yaml
        range: "DataHub!A1:Z100"
    }
)
// Check for #N/A, #DIV/0!, #REF! in returned values


Write operations (only for safe repairs):

// Add IFERROR wrapper to fix formula errors
mcp__gdrive__sheets(
    operation: "spreadsheets.values.update",
    params: {
        spreadsheetId: SPREADSHEET_ID,  // from user-profile.yaml
        range: "DataHub!C2:C2",
        valueInputOption: "USER_ENTERED",
        requestBody: {
            values: [["=IFERROR(GOOGLEFINANCE(A2, \"price\"), \"N/A\")"]]
        }
    }
)
