Do-Work Skill

A unified entry point for task capture and processing.

Actions:

do: Capture new tasks/requests → creates UR folder (verbatim input) + REQ files (queue items), always paired, then verifies coverage
work: Process pending requests → plans (with plan verification), explores, builds, tests
verify: Evaluate captured REQs against original input → coverage check with auto-fix (also runs automatically after capture)
cleanup: Consolidate archive → moves loose REQs into UR folders, closes completed URs

Core concept: The do action always produces both a UR folder (preserving the original input) and REQ files (the queue items). Each REQ links back to its UR via user_request frontmatter. This pairing is mandatory for all requests — simple or complex.

Capture ≠ Execute. The do action captures requests. The work action executes them. These are strictly separate operations. After the do action finishes writing files and reporting back, STOP. Do not start processing the queue, do not begin implementation, do not "helpfully" transition into the work action. The user decides when to execute — always. The only exception is if the user explicitly says something like "add this and then run it" or "capture this and start working" in the same invocation.

Routing Decision
Step 1: Parse the Input

Examine what follows "do work":

Check these patterns in order — first match wins:

Priority	Pattern	Example	Route
1	Empty or bare invocation	do work	→ Ask: "Start the work loop?"
2	Action verbs only	do work run, do work go, do work start	→ work
3	Verify keywords	do work verify, do work check, do work evaluate	→ verify
4	Cleanup keywords	do work cleanup, do work tidy, do work consolidate	→ cleanup
5	Version keywords	do work version, do work update, do work check for updates	→ version
6	Changelog keywords	do work changelog, do work release notes, do work what's new, do work what's changed, do work updates, do work history	→ version
7	Descriptive content	do work add dark mode, do work [meeting notes]	→ do
Step 2: Preserve Payload

Critical rule: Never lose the user's content.

Single-word rule: A single word is either a known keyword or ambiguous — it is never "descriptive content."

Matches a keyword in the routing table (e.g., "version", "verify", "cleanup") → route to that action directly.
Doesn't match any keyword (e.g., "refactor", "optimize") → ambiguous. Ask: "Do you want to add '{word}' as a new request, or did you mean something else?"

Only route to do when the input is clearly descriptive — multiple words, a sentence, a feature request, etc.

If routing is genuinely unclear AND multi-word content was provided:

Default to do (adding a task)
Hold onto $ARGUMENTS
If truly ambiguous, ask: "Add this as a request, or start the work loop?"
User replies with just "add" or "work" → proceed with original content
Action Verbs (→ Work)

These signal "process the queue": run, go, start, begin, work, process, execute, build, continue, resume

Verify Verbs (→ Verify)

These signal "check request quality": verify, check, evaluate, review requests, review reqs, audit

Note: "check" routes to verify ONLY when used alone or with a target (e.g., "do work check UR-003"). When followed by descriptive content it routes to do (e.g., "do work check if the button works" → do).

Cleanup Verbs (→ Cleanup)

These signal "consolidate the archive": cleanup, clean up, tidy, consolidate, organize archive, fix archive

Changelog Verbs (→ Version)

These signal "show release notes": changelog, release notes, what's new, what's changed, updates, history

Note: "updates" (plural) routes to changelog display. "update" (singular) routes to update check. Both are handled by the version action.

Content Signals (→ Do)

These signal "add a new task":

Descriptive text beyond a single verb
Feature requests, bug reports, ideas
Screenshots or context
"add", "create", "I need", "we should"
Examples
Routes to Work
do work → "Ready to process the queue?" (confirmation)
do work run → Starts work action immediately
do work go → Starts work action immediately
Routes to Verify
do work verify → Evaluates most recent UR's REQs
do work verify UR-003 → Evaluates specific UR
do work check REQ-018 → Evaluates the UR that REQ-018 belongs to
do work evaluate → Evaluates most recent UR's REQs
do work review requests → Evaluates most recent UR's REQs
Routes to Cleanup
do work cleanup → Consolidates archive, closes completed URs
do work tidy → Same as cleanup
do work consolidate → Same as cleanup
Routes to Changelog (via Version)
do work changelog → Displays changelog (newest at bottom)
do work release notes → Same as changelog
do work what's new → Same as changelog
do work updates → Same as changelog
do work history → Same as changelog
Routes to Do
do work add dark mode → Creates REQ file + UR folder
do work the button is broken → Creates REQ file + UR folder
do work [400 words] → Creates REQ files + UR folder with full verbatim input
Payload Preservation Rules

When clarification is needed but content was provided:

Do not lose $ARGUMENTS - keep the full payload in context
Ask a simple question: "Add this as a request, or start the work loop?"
Accept minimal replies: User says just "add" or "work"
Proceed with original content: Apply the chosen action to the stored arguments
Never ask the user to re-paste content

This enables a two-phase commit pattern:

Capture intent payload
Confirm action
Action References

Follow the detailed instructions in:

do action - Request capture
work action - Queue processing
verify-request action - Coverage verification of captured requests (runs after capture, or manually)
verify-plan action - Plan coverage verification (runs after planning in the work action)
cleanup action - Archive consolidation and UR closure
version action - Version, updates & changelog
