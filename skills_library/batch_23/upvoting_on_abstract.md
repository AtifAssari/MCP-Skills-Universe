Upvoting on Abstract

The Abstract Portal has an on-chain voting system where users spend ETH to upvote apps each epoch. Votes signal app quality and contribute to Portal XP.

Operating Rules
Check the vote cost with voteCost() before submitting a vote — the cost is set per epoch and may change.
Check remaining votes with userVotesRemaining(address) before voting.
The voteForApp function is payable — include the vote cost as value.
Each user can vote for each app only once per epoch (AlreadyVotedFor error).
Preview every vote with --dry-run before execution.
Read references/voting-contract.md for the full contract interface and error handling.

ABI Format

The AGW CLI requires full JSON ABI objects, not human-readable strings. Every abi array element must be an object with type, name, inputs, outputs, and stateMutability fields.

Task Map
Check vote cost and current epoch
agw contract write --json '{
  "address": "0x3b50de27506f0a8c1f4122a1e6f470009a76ce2a",
  "abi": [{"type":"function","name":"voteCost","stateMutability":"view","inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint96"}]}],
  "functionName": "voteCost",
  "args": []
}' --dry-run

agw contract write --json '{
  "address": "0x3b50de27506f0a8c1f4122a1e6f470009a76ce2a",
  "abi": [{"type":"function","name":"currentEpoch","stateMutability":"view","inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}]}],
  "functionName": "currentEpoch",
  "args": []
}' --dry-run

Check remaining votes
agw contract write --json '{
  "address": "0x3b50de27506f0a8c1f4122a1e6f470009a76ce2a",
  "abi": [{"type":"function","name":"userVotesRemaining","stateMutability":"view","inputs":[{"name":"user","type":"address"}],"outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}]}],
  "functionName": "userVotesRemaining",
  "args": ["<YOUR_ADDRESS>"]
}' --dry-run

Vote for an app

Replace <APP_ID> with the Portal app ID (e.g., 25 for Onchain Heroes) and <VOTE_COST> with the value from voteCost():

agw contract write --json '{
  "address": "0x3b50de27506f0a8c1f4122a1e6f470009a76ce2a",
  "abi": [{"type":"function","name":"voteForApp","stateMutability":"payable","inputs":[{"name":"appId","type":"uint256"}],"outputs":[]}],
  "functionName": "voteForApp",
  "args": ["<APP_ID>"],
  "value": "<VOTE_COST>"
}' --dry-run


Execute only after confirming the preview: replace --dry-run with --execute.

Check votes for a specific app
agw contract write --json '{
  "address": "0x3b50de27506f0a8c1f4122a1e6f470009a76ce2a",
  "abi": [{"type":"function","name":"getVotesForApp","stateMutability":"view","inputs":[{"name":"appId","type":"uint256"},{"name":"epoch","type":"uint256"}],"outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}]}],
  "functionName": "getVotesForApp",
  "args": ["<APP_ID>", "<EPOCH>"]
}' --dry-run


Use currentEpoch() to get the current epoch number first.

Check which apps a user voted for
agw contract write --json '{
  "address": "0x3b50de27506f0a8c1f4122a1e6f470009a76ce2a",
  "abi": [{"type":"function","name":"getUserVotes","stateMutability":"view","inputs":[{"name":"user","type":"address"},{"name":"epoch","type":"uint256"}],"outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256[]"}]}],
  "functionName": "getUserVotes",
  "args": ["<USER_ADDRESS>", "<EPOCH>"]
}' --dry-run


Returns an array of app IDs the user has voted for this epoch.

Voting Workflow
Check vote cost: voteCost() → returns cost in wei
Check remaining votes: userVotesRemaining(address) → returns count
Find the app ID via agw portal apps list or agw app list
Preview the vote: voteForApp(appId) with --dry-run and value set to vote cost
Execute after confirmation: --execute
Verify: getUserVotes(address, epoch) to confirm your vote was recorded
Error Handling
Error	Cause	Fix
InvalidValue	Sent wrong ETH amount	Send exactly voteCost() as value
VotingNotActive	Voting not open this epoch	Wait for next epoch
AppNotActive	App not eligible for votes	Verify app ID via Portal
AlreadyVotedFor	Already voted for this app this epoch	Choose a different app
UsedAllVotes	No remaining votes this epoch	Wait for next epoch
Escalation
Route app discovery to discovering-abstract-portal.
Route wallet balance checks to reading-agw-wallet.
Route transaction safety to executing-agw-transactions.
