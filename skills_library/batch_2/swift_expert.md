Summary

Complete iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS development with SwiftUI, async/await, protocol-oriented design, and actor-based concurrency.

Covers SwiftUI state management with @Observable, async/await patterns, protocol-oriented architecture with associated types, and actor isolation for thread safety
Includes validation checkpoints at each workflow stage: compilation verification, strict warning checks for actor isolation, and async test confirmation
Provides reference guides for SwiftUI patterns, concurrency, protocol design, memory management, and testing strategies with XCTest
Enforces Swift API Design Guidelines, Sendable compliance, value-type semantics, and comprehensive error handling across all implementations

Core Workflow
Architecture Analysis - Identify platform targets, dependencies, design patterns
Design Protocols - Create protocol-first APIs with associated types
Implement - Write type-safe code with async/await and value semantics
Optimize - Profile with Instruments, ensure thread safety
Test - Write comprehensive tests with XCTest and async patterns

Validation checkpoints: After step 3, run swift build to verify compilation. After step 4, run swift build -warnings-as-errors to surface actor isolation and Sendable warnings. After step 5, run swift test and confirm all async tests pass.

Code Patterns
async/await — Correct vs. Incorrect
// ✅ DO: async/await with structured error handling
func fetchUser(id: String) async throws -> User {
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/users/\(id)")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
}

// ❌ DON'T: mixing completion handlers with async context
func fetchUser(id: String) async throws -> User {
    return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
        // Avoid wrapping existing async APIs this way when a native async version exists
        legacyFetch(id: id) { result in
            continuation.resume(with: result)
        }
    }
}

SwiftUI State Management
// ✅ DO: use @Observable (Swift 5.9+) for view models
@Observable
final class CounterViewModel {
    var count = 0
    func increment() { count += 1 }
}

struct CounterView: View {
    @State private var vm = CounterViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("\(vm.count)")
            Button("Increment", action: vm.increment)
        }
    }
}

// ❌ DON'T: reach for ObservableObject/Published when @Observable suffices
class LegacyViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var count = 0  // Unnecessary boilerplate in Swift 5.9+
}

Protocol-Oriented Architecture
// ✅ DO: define capability protocols with associated types
protocol Repository<Entity> {
    associatedtype Entity: Identifiable
    func fetch(id: Entity.ID) async throws -> Entity
    func save(_ entity: Entity) async throws
}

struct UserRepository: Repository {
    typealias Entity = User
    func fetch(id: UUID) async throws -> User { /* … */ }
    func save(_ user: User) async throws { /* … */ }
}

// ❌ DON'T: use classes as base types when a protocol fits
class BaseRepository {  // Avoid class inheritance for shared behavior
    func fetch(id: UUID) async throws -> Any { fatalError("Override required") }
}

Actor for Thread Safety
// ✅ DO: isolate mutable shared state in an actor
actor ImageCache {
    private var cache: [URL: UIImage] = [:]

    func image(for url: URL) -> UIImage? { cache[url] }
    func store(_ image: UIImage, for url: URL) { cache[url] = image }
}

// ❌ DON'T: use a class with manual locking
class UnsafeImageCache {
    private var cache: [URL: UIImage] = [:]
    private let lock = NSLock()  // Error-prone; prefer actor isolation
    func image(for url: URL) -> UIImage? {
        lock.lock(); defer { lock.unlock() }
        return cache[url]
    }
}

Constraints
MUST DO
Use type hints and inference appropriately
Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
Use async/await for asynchronous operations (see pattern above)
Ensure Sendable compliance for concurrency
Use value types (struct/enum) by default
Document APIs with markup comments (/// …)
Use property wrappers for cross-cutting concerns
Profile with Instruments before optimizing
MUST NOT DO
Use force unwrapping (!) without justification
Create retain cycles in closures
Mix synchronous and asynchronous code improperly
Ignore actor isolation warnings
Use implicitly unwrapped optionals unnecessarily
Skip error handling
Use Objective-C patterns when Swift alternatives exist
Hardcode platform-specific values
Output Templates

When implementing Swift features, provide:

Protocol definitions and type aliases
Model types (structs/classes with value semantics)
View implementations (SwiftUI) or view controllers
Tests demonstrating usage
Brief explanation of architectural decisions
