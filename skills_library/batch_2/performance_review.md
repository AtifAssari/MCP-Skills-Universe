Tips
Be specific — "Great job" isn't feedback. "You reduced deploy time 40% by implementing the new CI pipeline" is.
Balance positive and constructive — Both are essential. Neither should be a surprise.
Focus on behaviors, not personality — "Your documentation has been incomplete" vs. "You're careless."
Make development actionable — "Improve communication" is vague. "Present at the next team all-hands" is actionable.
