AEO Escalation

Purpose: Human-AI interface for when to interrupt and involve humans. Presents clear, actionable options and records decisions for learning.

When to Escalate

Invoke this skill when:

Confidence score < 0.70 (advisory/blocking from aeo-core)
Spec score < 40 (refuse from aeo-spec-validator)
QA veto occurs (from aeo-qa-agent)
Failure pattern can't be resolved (from aeo-failure-patterns)
Cost limit approaching (if cost-governor enabled)
Architecture violation detected (if architecture skill enabled)
Escalation Framework

All escalations must follow this format:

⚠️ ESCALATION REQUIRED

[Clear one-line summary of the issue]

Context:
• [Why we're here - what triggered escalation]
• [What we've tried so far]
• [What's blocking progress]

Options:
1. [Clear, actionable option] - [Expected outcome]
2. [Clear, actionable option] - [Expected outcome]
3. [Clear, actionable option] - [Expected outcome]

Recommended: [Option X] - [Brief rationale]

Your choice (1-3):

Escalation Scenarios
Scenario 1: Low Confidence (Blocking)

Trigger: Confidence 0.50-0.69

⚠️ CONFIDENCE BELOW THRESHOLD

Confidence: 0.62
Threshold: 0.70 (Autonomous)

Task: Add user authentication with email verification

Context:
• Spec score: 68/100 (minor gaps)
• Risk: Touching authentication system
• Missing: Email service configuration
• Similar tasks: 2 successful, 1 failed

Concerns:
• [Spec] No email service specified
• [Risk] Auth changes require review
• [Context] Need email provider details

Options:
1. Proceed with Resend for emails (default) - Autonomously complete with assumptions
2. Provide email service details first - Improve spec, then execute autonomously
3. Break into smaller tasks - Create subtasks for review and approval

Recommended: Option 2 - Specify email service to improve confidence

Your choice (1-3):


After user responds:

Record decision to $PAI_DIR/MEMORY/aeo-escalations.jsonl
Update confidence model based on outcome
Continue with chosen path
Scenario 2: Spec Refused (Unacceptable)

Trigger: Spec score < 40

❌ CANNOT EXECUTE - SPEC TOO UNCLEAR

Spec Score: 28/100
Threshold: 40 (Minimum)

Task: Improve the signup

Why this was refused:
• Objective vague (5/15) - "improve" is subjective
• No acceptance criteria (0/15) - What defines "done"?
• Missing context (0/10) - Which signup flow?
• No dependencies listed (0/10)
• Ambiguity penalty: -10 (vague verb "improve")

What's needed:
1. **Clear Objective:** What specific improvement?
2. **Acceptance Criteria:** How do we measure success?
3. **Context:** Which page/component?
4. **Dependencies:** Libraries, APIs, services?

Good spec example:
"Add email validation to /pages/auth/signup.tsx using validator.js.
 Must validate RFC 5322, reject + aliases, show inline errors.
 Tests for valid, invalid, duplicate emails."

Options:
1. Provide improved spec - I'll wait for your updated specification
2. Answer clarifying questions - I'll ask specific questions to build spec
3. Use template - I'll provide a spec template for you to fill

Recommended: Option 2 - Answer questions to build spec together

Your choice (1-3):

Scenario 3: QA Veto (Security Issue)

Trigger: Security vulnerability detected

🚨 SECURITY VETO - CANNOT PROCEED

Issue: SQL Injection vulnerability
File: /routes/users.js:Line 47
Severity: CRITICAL

Current Code:
```javascript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`


Why this is dangerous: • User input directly interpolated into SQL query • Attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands • Can expose, modify, or delete all data

Required Fix:

const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1'
await db.query(query, [userId])


Action Required: • This MUST be fixed before commit • No exceptions - security is non-negotiable • All changes with security issues are blocked

Options:

Fix immediately - I'll apply the required fix now
Review fix together - I'll show you the fix for approval
Explain more - I'll provide detailed explanation of vulnerability

Recommended: Option 1 - Fix immediately (this is a critical issue)

Your choice (1-3):

### Scenario 4: Failure Pattern Not Recognized

**Trigger:** Error not in core patterns or project patterns



❌ CANNOT AUTO-FIX - PATTERN NOT RECOGNIZED

Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')

Searched: • 20 core patterns - No match • 12 project patterns - No match • Fuzzy match: None with confidence ≥ 0.70

Context: • File: /src/services/UserService.js:125 • Function: fetchUserData() • Error occurred during: API call processing

Stack trace: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data') at UserService.fetchUserData (/src/services/UserService.js:125) at async Component.render (/src/components/UserList.tsx:45)

What I've tried: • Verified module is installed ✓ • Checked imports - all valid ✓ • Reviewed recent changes - no obvious issues ✗

Options:

Provide fix - If you know the solution, I'll apply it
Investigate together - I'll add logging and we'll debug
Create new pattern - After we fix it, I'll save this pattern for future

Recommended: Option 2 - Investigate together to understand root cause

Your choice (1-3):

### Scenario 5: Cost Limit Warning

**Trigger:** Budget 80% consumed



⚠️ COST LIMIT APPROACHING

Budget Status: • Daily budget: $10.00 • Used so far: $8.47 (84.7%) • Remaining: $1.53 • Tasks completed: 7

Current task estimate: ~$0.75 Projected overage: ~$0.22 if we continue

Options:

Continue anyway - Proceed with current task (may exceed budget)
Pause and review - Review completed work, decide what's essential
Adjust scope - Complete current task with reduced scope

Recommended: Option 2 - Review progress before continuing

Your choice (1-3):


---

### Scenario 6: Architecture Violation

**Trigger:** Circular dependency detected



⚠️ ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION DETECTED

Issue: Circular dependency between modules

Circular Path: → fileA.js imports fileB.js → fileB.js imports fileA.js → (cycle detected)

Why this matters: • Creates tight coupling • Makes code hard to test • Can cause runtime errors • Violates clean architecture principles

Options:

Extract shared code - Create new module for shared functionality
Refactor dependencies - Restructure to remove cycle
Defer to architect - Let architecture skill analyze and propose solution

Recommended: Option 1 - Extract shared code (most common pattern)

## Decision Recording

After human chooses an option, record to memory:

```bash
# Append to escalation log
echo '{
  "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "task_id": "unique-id",
  "escalation_type": "low_confidence|spec_refused|qa_veto|pattern_unknown|cost_warning|arch_violation",
  "confidence_before": 0.62,
  "option_presented": [1, 2, 3],
  "option_chosen": 2,
  "human_input": "User provided email service details",
  "resolution": "Improved spec, confidence increased to 0.85",
  "success": true,
  "learning": "Context details improve confidence by ~0.20"
}' >> ~/.claude/MEMORY/aeo-escalations.jsonl

Learning from Escalations

Weekly Analysis:

# Read escalation patterns
jq -s 'group_by(.escalation_type) | map({type: .[0].escalation_type, count: length})' \
  ~/.claude/MEMORY/aeo-escalations.jsonl


Insights to track:

Most common escalation types
Which options are chosen most frequently
Average confidence after escalation
Resolution time
Success rate of different options
Integration Flow
Trigger received from another AEO skill
Format escalation with clear options
Present to human with recommended option
Wait for response
Record decision to memory
Execute chosen option
Follow up - Was the resolution successful?
Learn - Update escalation patterns
Best Practices

DO:

Always provide 2-4 clear, actionable options
Include a recommended option with rationale
Explain context clearly (what led to escalation)
Keep options mutually exclusive
Make options specific and actionable
Record outcome for future learning

DON'T:

Present vague options like "continue or stop"
Overwhelm with >4 options
Skip the recommendation
Forget to explain the context
Present options that aren't actually available
Skip recording the outcome
Example Session
AEO-Core: Confidence 0.52 - below threshold
        [Invokes aeo-escalation]

Escalation: ⚠️ CONFIDENCE BELOW THRESHOLD

           Confidence: 0.52
           Threshold: 0.70

           Task: Refactor authentication system

           Concerns:
           • [Spec] No clear requirements defined
           • [Risk] Touching critical auth system
           • [Scope] Large, unclear boundaries

           Options:
           1. Define requirements first - Create detailed spec
           2. Break into smaller tasks - Create manageable subtasks
           3. Get architect approval - Ensure approach is sound

           Recommended: Option 1 - Define requirements

Human: 1

Escalation: [Recording choice]
           What specific requirements do you need documented?

Human: We need to support OAuth, JWT, and API keys

Escalation: [Updating spec]
           [Recalculating confidence...]
           New confidence: 0.78 ✓

           Proceeding with implementation.

Escalation Outcomes

Track outcomes to improve escalation quality:

Successful Outcomes:

Human provides needed info → Task completes
Issue resolved → Continue autonomously
Learning captured → Better future decisions

Unsuccessful Outcomes:

Wrong option recommended → Adjust recommendation logic
Unclear options → Improve option clarity
Missing context → Add more context to escalation
Repeated escalations → Identify root cause

Use outcomes to refine escalation patterns and recommendations.
