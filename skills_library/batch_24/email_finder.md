Email Finder
Overview

Discover email addresses associated with a domain using a hybrid approach: free methods first (web scraping, pattern guessing, WHOIS lookup), then APIs (Hunter.io, Apollo.io, etc.) when keys are available.

When to Use
Scan a domain to find associated emails
Find contact emails for a company
Replace email hunter functionality
Find email patterns for a domain
Verify email addresses
Enrich contact data with discovered emails
Project Context Discovery

Before finding emails:

Check for existing email discovery tools
Review available API keys (Hunter.io, Apollo.io)
Check compliance/privacy requirements
Look for project-specific [project]-email-finder skill
Methodology
Free Methods (Primary)
Web Scraping - Scan /contact, /about, /team pages for emails
WHOIS Lookup - Query domain registration data
Pattern Guessing - Generate patterns from names found on site:
firstname.lastname@domain.com
firstnamelastname@domain.com
firstname@domain.com
f.lastname@domain.com
API Methods (If Keys Available)
API	Env Variable	Purpose
Hunter.io	HUNTER_API_KEY	Domain search + verification
Apollo.io	APOLLO_API_KEY	Contact discovery
Snov.io	SNOV_CLIENT_ID/SECRET	Email finder
Clearbit	CLEARBIT_API_KEY	Company enrichment
Email Result Interface
interface EmailResult {
  email: string;
  source: 'web-scraping' | 'whois' | 'pattern-guessing' | 'hunter' | 'apollo';
  confidence?: number;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  position?: string;
  verified?: boolean;
}

Best Practices
Rate limiting: Delay between requests (1s recommended)
Respect robots.txt: Check before scraping
Deduplicate: Normalize emails (lowercase, trim)
Verify: Use MX record checks or API verification
Filter: Remove noreply@, donotreply@ addresses
Legal & Ethical
Comply with GDPR/CCPA
Respect terms of service
Honor opt-out requests
Don't spam discovered emails
Integration

Works well with:

leads-researcher - Discover contact emails after researching companies
copywriter - Use found emails for outreach campaigns
