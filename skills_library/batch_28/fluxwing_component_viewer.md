Fluxwing Component Viewer

View detailed information about a specific uxscii component from any source.

Data Location Rules

READ from (bundled templates - reference only):

{SKILL_ROOT}/../uxscii-component-creator/templates/ - 11 component templates
{SKILL_ROOT}/../uxscii-screen-scaffolder/templates/ - 2 screen examples (if available)

READ from (project workspace):

./fluxwing/components/ - Your created components
./fluxwing/library/ - Customized template copies
./fluxwing/screens/ - Your created screens

NEVER write - this is a read-only viewer!

Your Task

Display comprehensive details about a single uxscii component, including metadata, ASCII template preview, and context-appropriate actions.

Component Lookup Process
1. Parse Component Name
Extract component name from user request
If no name provided: Ask "Which component would you like to view?"
Normalize name to lowercase with hyphens
2. Search Priority Order (Stop at First Match)

Search these locations in order and stop at the first match:

Project Components: ./fluxwing/components/[name].uxm

User/agent-created custom components
Fully editable
Tag as: "Your Component"

Project Library: ./fluxwing/library/[name].uxm

Customized copies of bundled templates
Fully editable
Tag as: "Your Library"

Bundled Templates: {SKILL_ROOT}/../uxscii-component-creator/templates/[name].uxm

Read-only reference templates
Must be copied to edit
Tag as: "Bundled Template"

Important: Stop searching after first match. If found in bundled templates, check if it also exists in user's project and add a note: "💡 You also have a customized version in ./fluxwing/library/"

3. Read Component Files

For the matched component, read both files:

[name].uxm - JSON metadata
[name].md - ASCII template
Display Format
Concise View (Default)

Present component information in a clean, scannable format:
