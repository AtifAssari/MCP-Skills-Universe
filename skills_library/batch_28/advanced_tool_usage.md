Advanced Tool Usage
Core Principles
Context Economy: Never bring raw, voluminous data into the conversation if you only need a refined subset.
Pipeline Thinking: View tools as modular blocks that can pass data through files.
Offloading: Use redirect_tool_call to "capture" output into external storage.
Patterns
1. The Pipelining Pattern

When a tool's output is the input for another tool:

Redirect: Call the first tool using redirect_tool_call.
Process: Call the second tool (e.g., python_execute or shell_execute) and pass the file path created in step 1 as an argument.
Refine: Read only the final processed result into the conversation.
2. The Context Buffer Pattern

When working with large files or long logs:

Redirect the reading tool (e.g., cat, mcp_call) to a temporary file.
Use rg or grep to extract only the relevant lines from that file.
3. Workspace Management for Pipelines

When building multi-stage pipelines that generate multiple files:

Use shell_execute with mktemp -d to create a dedicated scratch directory.
Direct all intermediate redirect_tool_call outputs into that directory to keep the workspace clean.
Example: redirect_tool_call(..., output_file="/tmp/tmp.X/step1.json")
4. The Large Data Export

When the user requests a result that is too large for markdown (e.g., a 5MB JSON dump):

Use redirect_tool_call with a specific output_file name.
Inform the user of the file location instead of printing the content.
When to use redirect_tool_call
The expected output is > 50 lines and the tool does NOT support its own redirection (e.g., searches, API calls).
The output is raw data (JSON, CSV) that needs further processing by another tool.
You are chaining an MCP tool into a local processing tool.

Note: For shell_execute or python_execute, always use internal file writing (> or file.write()) instead of redirect_tool_call for maximum efficiency.
