ClickHouse Best Practices (TypeScript, Python)

ClickHouse data modeling best practices extended with MooseStack TypeScript and Python examples. 28 rules across 3 categories (schema, query, insert), prioritized by impact.

MooseStack docs: MooseStack Documentation ClickHouse docs: ClickHouse Best Practices

IMPORTANT: How to Apply This Skill

Two modes — pick the right one for the situation:

Inline mode (default — use this during authoring / optimization)

When the user is actively building or iterating on code, apply rules inline:

Identify which 1–2 rules are directly relevant to the current decision (e.g. choosing an ORDER BY, picking a type, deciding on batch size).
Read only those rule file(s). Do not pre-emptively read 6+ rules.
Apply the rule immediately in the code you're writing; cite the rule name in a brief comment or sentence (e.g. "Per schema-pk-cardinality-order, ORDER BY user_id, event_ts.").
Keep moving — continue writing the pipeline, schema, or query. Do NOT stop to emit a "Rules Checked / Findings" audit.

Use the Quick Reference table and Rule Categories below to find the right rule fast.

Review mode (only when the user asks for a review/audit)

If the user explicitly says "review", "audit", "check for violations", or "what's wrong with this schema?" — and existing code is present to review — then follow the Review Procedures section below, read the listed rule files in order, and emit the structured Output Format.

Never enter review mode during greenfield authoring or time-boxed pipeline construction unless the user specifically asks for it. Writing working code first and checking rules along the way is almost always the right call.

Why rules take priority (either mode): ClickHouse has specific behaviors (columnar storage, sparse indexes, merge tree mechanics) where general database intuition can be misleading. The rules encode validated guidance with MooseStack-specific patterns for TypeScript and Python.

For Formal Reviews

When the user explicitly requests a review:

Review Procedures
For MooseStack Data Model Reviews (TypeScript/Python)

Read these rule files in order:

rules/schema-types-native-types.md - Type annotation mapping
rules/schema-types-minimize-bitwidth.md - Use UInt8, UInt16 etc.
rules/schema-types-lowcardinality.md - string & LowCardinality annotation
rules/schema-types-avoid-nullable.md - ClickHouseDefault instead of ?
rules/schema-pk-cardinality-order.md - orderByFields ordering
rules/schema-partition-lifecycle.md - partitionByField and TTL

Check for:

 Proper type annotations (Key<T>, UInt64, LowCardinality, etc.)
 OlapTable has orderByFields in low-to-high cardinality order
 Optional fields use ClickHouseDefault instead of ? where possible
 engine specified for update/delete patterns (ReplacingMergeTree, etc.)
 indexes for non-ORDER BY filter columns
For Schema Reviews (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE)

Read these rule files in order:

rules/schema-pk-plan-before-creation.md - ORDER BY is immutable
rules/schema-pk-cardinality-order.md - Column ordering in keys
rules/schema-pk-prioritize-filters.md - Filter column inclusion
rules/schema-types-native-types.md - Proper type selection
rules/schema-types-minimize-bitwidth.md - Numeric type sizing
rules/schema-types-lowcardinality.md - LowCardinality usage
rules/schema-types-avoid-nullable.md - Nullable vs DEFAULT
rules/schema-partition-low-cardinality.md - Partition count limits
rules/schema-partition-lifecycle.md - Partitioning purpose

Check for:

 PRIMARY KEY / ORDER BY column order (low-to-high cardinality)
 Data types match actual data ranges
 LowCardinality applied to appropriate string columns
 Partition key cardinality bounded (100-1,000 values)
 ReplacingMergeTree has version column if used
For Query Reviews (SELECT, JOIN, aggregations)

Read these rule files:

rules/query-join-choose-algorithm.md - Algorithm selection
rules/query-join-filter-before.md - Pre-join filtering
rules/query-join-use-any.md - ANY vs regular JOIN
rules/query-index-skipping-indices.md - Secondary index usage
rules/schema-pk-filter-on-orderby.md - Filter alignment with ORDER BY

Check for:

 Filters use ORDER BY prefix columns
 JOINs filter tables before joining (not after)
 Correct JOIN algorithm for table sizes
 Skipping indices for non-ORDER BY filter columns
For Insert Strategy Reviews (data ingestion, updates, deletes)

Read these rule files:

rules/insert-batch-size.md - Batch sizing requirements
rules/insert-mutation-avoid-update.md - UPDATE alternatives
rules/insert-mutation-avoid-delete.md - DELETE alternatives
rules/insert-async-small-batches.md - Async insert usage
rules/insert-optimize-avoid-final.md - OPTIMIZE TABLE risks

Check for:

 Batch size 10K-100K rows per INSERT
 No ALTER TABLE UPDATE for frequent changes
 ReplacingMergeTree or CollapsingMergeTree for update patterns
 Async inserts enabled for high-frequency small batches
Output Format

Structure your response as follows:

## Rules Checked
- `rule-name-1` - Compliant / Violation found
- `rule-name-2` - Compliant / Violation found
...

## Findings

### Violations
- **`rule-name`**: Description of the issue
  - Current: [what the code does]
  - Required: [what it should do]
  - Fix: [specific correction]

### Compliant
- `rule-name`: Brief note on why it's correct

## Recommendations
[Prioritized list of changes, citing rules]
