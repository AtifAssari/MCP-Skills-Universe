Summary

Merge multiple CSV or Excel files with intelligent column matching and automatic deduplication.

Performs fuzzy column matching to align headers across files with different naming conventions (e.g., "firstname" to "first_name", "e-mail" to "email")
Detects and resolves duplicate records using configurable strategies: keep first, keep last, keep longest value, or flag for manual review
Handles schema mismatches, encoding detection, and data type normalization across files
Generates detailed merge reports including conflict logs, data quality metrics, deduplication statistics, and source file tracking for each row
Supports multiple output formats: CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL INSERT statements, and Parquet for large datasets

CSV/Excel Merger

Intelligently merge multiple CSV or Excel files with automatic column matching and data deduplication.

Instructions

When a user needs to merge CSV or Excel files:

Analyze Input Files:

How many files need to be merged?
What format (CSV, Excel, TSV)?
Are the files provided or need to be read from disk?
Do columns have the same names across files?
What is the primary key (unique identifier)?

Inspect File Structures:

Read headers from each file
Identify column names and data types
Detect encoding (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)
Check for missing columns
Look for duplicate column names

Create Merge Strategy:

Column Matching:

Exact name match: "email" = "email"
Case-insensitive: "Email" = "email"
Fuzzy match: "E-mail" ≈ "email"
Common patterns:
"first_name", "firstname", "First Name" → "first_name"
"phone", "phone_number", "tel" → "phone"
"email", "e-mail", "email_address" → "email"

Conflict Resolution (when same record appears in multiple files):

Keep first: Use value from first file
Keep last: Use value from last file (most recent)
Keep longest: Use most complete value
Manual review: Flag conflicts for user review
Merge: Combine non-conflicting fields

Deduplication:

Identify duplicate rows based on primary key
Options: keep first, keep last, keep all, merge values
Track source file for each row

Perform Merge:

# Example merge logic
import pandas as pd

# Read files
df1 = pd.read_csv('file1.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv('file2.csv')

# Normalize column names
df1.columns = df1.columns.str.lower().str.strip()
df2.columns = df2.columns.str.lower().str.strip()

# Map similar columns
column_mapping = {
    'firstname': 'first_name',
    'e_mail': 'email',
    # ...
}
df2 = df2.rename(columns=column_mapping)

# Merge
merged = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)

# Deduplicate
merged = merged.drop_duplicates(subset=['email'], keep='last')

# Save
merged.to_csv('merged_output.csv', index=False)

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Review 47 conflict records manually
• Standardize phone number format
• Fill missing company names (8.7% incomplete)
• Export conflicts to: conflicts_review.csv


Handle Special Cases:

Multiple Primary Keys:

Use compound keys: (email + company)
Offer options when ambiguous

Different Data Types:

Convert dates to standard format
Normalize phone numbers
Standardize country codes
Clean whitespace and casing

Missing Columns:

Fill with empty values
Flag missing data
Offer to create new columns

Large Files:

Use chunking for files > 100MB
Show progress indicator
Estimate memory usage

Generate Code: Provide Python/pandas script that:

Reads all files
Performs intelligent column matching
Deduplicates based on strategy
Resolves conflicts
Saves merged output
Generates detailed report

Export Options:

CSV (UTF-8)
Excel (.xlsx)
JSON
SQL INSERT statements
Parquet (for large datasets)
Example Triggers
"Merge these three CSV files"
"Combine multiple Excel sheets into one file"
"Deduplicate and merge customer data"
"Join spreadsheets with different column names"
"Consolidate contact lists from different sources"
Best Practices

Column Matching:

Use fuzzy matching for similar names
Maintain original column name mapping report
Allow manual override of auto-matching

Data Quality:

Trim whitespace
Standardize formats (phone, email, dates)
Detect and flag invalid data
Preserve data types

Performance:

Use chunking for large files
Process in batches
Show progress for long operations
Optimize memory usage

Transparency:

Log all merge decisions
Track source file for each row
Report conflicts and resolutions
Generate detailed merge report
Output Quality

Ensure merges:

Intelligently match columns
Handle different schemas
Deduplicate properly
Preserve data integrity
Flag conflicts for review
Generate comprehensive report
Maintain data quality
Track data lineage (source)
Handle edge cases gracefully
Provide validation statistics

Generate clean, deduplicated merged files with full transparency and data quality checks.
