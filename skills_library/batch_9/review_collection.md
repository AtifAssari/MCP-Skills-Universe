review-collection

Review an Ansible collection and produce a structured severity report. This command never modifies files.

Required Inputs
collection identification — namespace.name or path to collection root (resolved from discovery if not provided)
Behavior
Step 1 — Discovery

Run discovery per references/discovery.md. Locate the collection:

By namespace.name in collections_path directories
By path if provided directly
Step 2 — Load Collection

Read galaxy.yml, meta/runtime.yml, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE. Scan plugins/, roles/, playbooks/, tests/ directories.

Step 3 — Generate Severity Report
## Collection Review: <namespace>.<name>
Path: <collection_path>
Version: <version>
Reviewed: <timestamp>

Module syntax error	A plugin file has a Python syntax error	[plugins/modules/<file>] Python syntax error: <error>
WARNING
Check	Condition	Message

galaxy.yml: no tags	tags field absent or empty	[galaxy.yml] No tags set — add relevant tags to improve Galaxy discoverability
Role quality issues	Any role fails review-role checks	For each failing role, add a WARNING with the role name and check that failed
Module missing DOCUMENTATION	A plugin module lacks the DOCUMENTATION constant	[plugins/modules/<file>] Module is missing DOCUMENTATION block — required for ansible-doc
Module missing EXAMPLES	A plugin module lacks the EXAMPLES constant	[plugins/modules/<file>] Module is missing EXAMPLES block
Module missing RETURN	A plugin module lacks the RETURN constant	[plugins/modules/<file>] Module is missing RETURN block
Missing test guidance for plugins	Collection contains plugins but no ansible-test or usage guidance	[tests/] Collection contains plugins but has no clear validation path aligned with references/testing.md
INFO
Check	Condition	Message
No roles defined	roles/ directory is empty	No roles found in roles/ — use /ansible-designer:new-role to add a role
No tests defined	tests/ directory is empty	No tests found — consider adding integration tests for CI validation

galaxy.yml: no repository	repository field absent	[galaxy.yml] No repository URL set
galaxy.yml: description too long	description > 255 characters	[galaxy.yml] Description is <N> characters — Galaxy recommends under 255
Role Quality Checks

For each role found in roles/:

Run the review-role checks (FQCN, tags, no_log, meta/main.yml validity, handler correctness)
Prefix each finding with [roles/<role_name>]
Include role issues in the appropriate severity sections
Constraints
Never modify files. This command is read-only.
Do not generate fixed versions of any file.
Conclude with: "Use /ansible-designer:update-collection to apply fixes."
