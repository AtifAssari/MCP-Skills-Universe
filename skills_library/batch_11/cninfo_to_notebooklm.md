Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 0: Environment Setup (First Run Only)

Crucial: Before running the script, verify the environment is ready.

Check Dependencies: Verify if the dependencies are installed (specifically notebooklm and playwright).

Install: If dependencies are missing or this is the first run, execute the installation script:

chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh


Authenticate: Ensure the user has authenticated with NotebookLM (notebooklm login). If not, ask them to do so.

Step 1: Run Main Orchestration Script

Run the script from the skill directory:

python3 scripts/run.py <stock_code_or_name>


Examples:

python3 scripts/run.py 600350 - A-share stock
python3 scripts/run.py 山东高速 - A-share by name
python3 scripts/run.py 00700 - Hong Kong stock (Tencent)
python3 scripts/run.py 腾讯控股 - Hong Kong by name

This script handles everything:

Downloads reports to a temp directory.
Creates a NotebookLM notebook.
Configures the notebook with assets/financial_analyst_prompt.txt.
Uploads all PDFs.
Cleans up temp files.
Step 2: Report to User

Provide:

✅ Number of reports downloaded & uploaded
📚 NotebookLM notebook ID
📊 Market type (A-share or Hong Kong)
💡 Remind user the notebook creates a "Financial Analyst" persona for deep analysis.
Configuration

The skill uses a custom system prompt located at: assets/financial_analyst_prompt.txt

This prompt configures NotebookLM to act as a "Financial Report Analyst" based on "Hand-holding Financial Reporting" methodology.
